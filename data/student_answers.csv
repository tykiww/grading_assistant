After years of strong gains,American craft brewers are now bracingfor a shakeout. Shipments are falling for many independent brewers stuck in the middle between local niche brands and competitors that were bought by heavyweights such as Anheuser-Busch InBev and Molson Coors. There were 5,562 total breweries in the U.S. as of June 30, up roughly 900 from the previous June, according to the Brewers Association. Besides Sierra Nevada, those losing ground include Sam Adams maker Boston Beer Co., the biggest independent brewer, as well as smaller producers such as F.X. Matt Brewing Co., which brews Saranac in upstate New York, and Abita Brewing Co. in Louisiana, according to Beer Marketer’s Insights.
Analyst Benj Steinman said many craft brewers trying to push into regional and national markets are finding they hit a wall once they surpass 100,000 barrels. Some have stretched themselves too thin and lost ground in their home markets, while others took on too much debt to expand brewing capacity, brewers said. As they expand, they also lose the cachet of being a local brand—something many consumers seek out.
“We really had to put our big-boy underpants on and up our game,” said Sam Calagione, founder and CEO of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. Dogfish Head, Saranac, Abita and other brewers grappling with soft sales say they are cutting costs, spending more on marketing and speeding up the launch of new products. Some aretrying to attract fans of whiskey, wine or margaritas with beers aged in casks, infused with grapes or flavored with limes.
Shipments are still rising for many of those craft brewers that sold themselves to industry heavyweights, including Lagunitas, which was bought by Heineken in May; Goose Island, owned by AB InBev since 2011; and Ballast Point, which was purchased byConstellation BrandsInc. for $1 billion.

FanDuel has bumped up its sign-up promotion to $200 in bonuses for a $5 bet for the NFL season, up from $150 last year. It also made a deal withAlphabet’s YouTube to give its new and existing betting customers $100 discounts on YouTube’s NFL Sunday Ticket subscriptions for a $5 bet until Sept. 18.
Fanatics, the sports merchandise company and betting newcomer, is giving $150 in credits for team merchandise such as jerseys for new customers who make a bet of at least $50. DraftKings is offering a $200 bonus for a $5 bet by new customers as it did last year.

The world’s largest company by market value, Apple, updated the key product line of its largest business two weeks ago. The new iPhone 15 family turned out to be mostly as expected, with enhanced camera features and USB-C charging ports on all models and titanium casing with a new central processing chip on the Pro devices.
One surprise, though, was Apple avoiding an across-the-board price hike. Prices on the different memory configurations of the iPhone 15 family are identical to last year’s iPhone 14 lineup, with the only exception being theremoval of a 128GB versionof the Pro Max—the lowest priced phone in that lineup. That trick raised the average selling price of the Pro family by less than 2%. Numerous leaks ahead of the event suggest Apple was planning a more significant bump, leading several analysts to project an increase of $100-$200 across at least the new iPhone Pro family. That would have resulted in the average selling price of that crucial lineup rising by at least 8%.

That effort paid off in the past 12 months as its customers seemed relatively unfazed as the London-based company raised prices.
The company said net sales for the year ending June 30 rose 21.4%, with growth across all its regions. The company reported mid-single digit growth from price increases across all regions and sold a higher percentage of pricier booze such as premium scotch and tequila compared with the previous year.
Volume increases contributed 10.3 percentage points of the 21.4% net sales growth, with price and product mix accounting for the rest of the 21.4% sales growth. Net profit climbed 22% to 3.25 billion pounds, equivalent to $3.96 billion.

Intel dominates in semiconductors at the computational heart of personal computers, but it has long ceded the market for videogaming graphics chips (GPUs) to Nvidia and AMD. Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger on Tuesday signaled the company would re-enter that field, releasing a GPU for gamers that is slated to be available on Oct. 12.
Intel’s pitch, Mr. Gelsinger said, would be to gamers tired of paying sky-high prices for the fastest, most advanced graphics chips. “They’ve just gotten super expensive, and we don’t think they need to be. We’re about to fix that,” he said at an annual company conference.
Intel’s cards will start at $329, he said. Nvidia last week unveiled a new generation of graphics processors priced at up to $1,599, although Intel’s GPUs aren’t expected to challenge those high-end cards on performance, instead aiming to be price-competitive with older-generation chips.
The GPU market has grown rapidly in recent years, both due to a surge in videogaming during the pandemic and because those chips have demonstrated to be adept at artificial intelligence calculations that are gaining more widespread adoption.

At first glance, the new hotel chain on track to be the fastest-growing in the U.S. resembles a boutique brand that might be found in a trendy, urban location. But Hilton’s new mid-price brand, Tru, is pricing rooms at around $100 a night or less and is largely aimed at less-flashy locales like suburban highway exits. The first Tru by Hilton hotel opened in May in Oklahoma City, to be followed by more than 200 locations in the US.
Hilton hopes to expand its customer base by focusing on a lower end of the market than the company has typically operated, but plans to differentiate itself from competitors in the same price range, such as Best Western or Quality Inn. The market is enormous: About 30% of nightly demand at U.S. hotel chains is for rooms below an average of $83 a night.
The challenge, however, is convincing developers that building new hotels in that price range will generate sufficient returns. To make the returns worth the new development costs, Hilton had to rethink the design to get more rooms across a smaller amount of space. Another way the company keeps costs down is through designs that allow for some part of the construction process to be done offsite.
Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range. The overall footprint of the property is smaller, too, and will largely be away from big-city centers, keeping land costs down. Openings in coming months are scheduled in places like Farmville, Va., and Cheyenne, Wyo.
In exchange, Tru hotels have a lobby that is more than 80% larger than Hilton’s typical Hampton Inn location, which is priced slightly higher than Tru. The brightly-colored lobbies have a self-serve market area where guests can get drinks like Craft beer and food, and also boasts recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work.
The rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. Rather than carpet, floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped, and in-room desks and coffee makers have been banished, also to cut down on cleaning times.
“We have been laser-focused on what numbers we absolutely need to hit,” said Alex Jaritz, global head of the Tru brand.
Other competitors cautioned that achieving the right returns can be tricky at more affordable price points. “A lot of people try to enter this marketplace and find it’s not as easy as they believe it is,” said Chip Ohlsson, executive vice president and chief development officer for North America atWyndham Hotel Group,which runs the Ramada and Wingate chains. “Where we operate, there’s less margin for error.”

",12,"2692647: Together, Monsanto and Corteva sell roughly 70% of all corn and soybean seeds planted in the U.S. The companies are in hot competition for the billions of dollars that farmers spend each year on seed-and-chemical combinations designed to combat hard-to-kill weeds. 
Monsanto’s Roundup Ready soybeans represented more than 90% of the market for roughly two decades, according to analysts. The company added dicamba to the mix to combat weeds that had developed resistance to Roundup’s main ingredient, glyphosate, to develop its new Xtend and XtendFlex products in 2017, which now make up about 45% to 50% of the U.S. soybean market.
Dicamba, however,can evaporate off crops and drift in the wind, sometimes damaging neighboring crops that lack resistance to it. Some farmers were fearful of the headaches and liability that came along with the spray. To prevent dicamba from drifting under summer heat, some states placed limits around when dicamba can be sprayed on crops, dissuading some growers from using Monsanto’s product.
Corteva in 2019 launched its competing soybean-and-spray combination, called Enlist E3, built around a herbicide known as 2,4-D choline. That weedkiller doesn’t have the same problem with drift, according to various studies and field work by university agricultural researchers.
Restrictions on Monsanto’s spray have become a selling point for Corteva. At an August farm show in Decatur, Ill., Corteva sales representatives told growers that Enlist doesn’t have the same spraying limitations as its competitor’s product. Corteva displayed signs that said “I have the freedom to spray.”
Question 18
Use the value proposition statement to explain how Corteva has been able to gain market share from Monsanto in the soybean seed + herbicide market.",8,"2692648: Dyson Ltd., best known for its high-end vacuum cleaners, said Tuesday it plans to build electric cars. The closely held British company said a manufacturing facility would be built in 2 years and that its vehicles—set to compete against electric-car pioneer Tesla Inc. and other major auto makers—would go on sale the following year.
Dyson, which makes a range of household appliances, unveiled plans to expand into car makinglast year, pledging to commit £2 billion ($2.6 billion) to the project, including £200 million on U.K.-based testing and research-and-development facilities.
The company faces a tough challenge breaking into an auto industry dominated by players with deep pockets and years of car-making know-how. But Dyson has made a mark around the globe by fusing innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances such as vacuum cleaners, fans and hand dryers.
The company has said it plans to rely on those credentials in developing electric vehicles, and that it won’t collaborate with other car makers. Dyson already makes components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries. Its teams in Singapore have made 50 million high-speed digital motors, an essential element of electric cars.

“Oracle’s strategy is very explicit in that they intend to capture share at the infrastructure layer by being very competitive on price performance,” saidDeutsche Bank analystBrad Zelnick. “They are pricing raw infrastructure at a discount to the market leaders, full stop.”
Oracle said that based on data from 2020, it is 61% cheaper thanAmazon Web Services for core computing services, and 38% cheaper than Google Cloud for the same services. Based on one customer’s recent projections over a five-year period, Oracle claims that customer would pay more than double for similar services on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.
Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue rose 66% to about $1.5 billion last week for the last quarter. Analysts peg Oracle’s cloud business at about 2% of total cloud revenue. Amazon, Microsoft, Google Cloud andAlibabaare the top players in the $120.3 billion cloud infrastructure global market in 2022.

Now luxury cars are getting in on the trend.
In Miami Beach, the Porsche Design Tower has the same sleek, souped-up masculine energy of the cars. There is no dedicated pedestrian access. Visitors arrive beneath a graphite-hued archway bearing the words “Porsche Design,” where they can park and enter the airy lobby or continue in their vehicles into the building’s patented car elevator, called the Dezervator, which whisks both cars and drivers up 60 stories to units with sky-high garages.
That elevator — which deposits cars behind a glass wall in front of each unit — is “a highlight” of the building, said Stefan Buescher, the chief executive of Porsche Lifestyle Group, in a statement. ""It was a natural continuation to transfer our unique design principles to the world of real estate,” he said.
The developer spent $480 million to build the Porsche Design Tower, where 132 units run between $4 and $32 million. Ten percent of the construction cost, he estimates, was on the production of the Dezervator alone.

Suburban hwy exits: Saves on cost of real estate and targets people on road trips (who are more cost-conscious than air travelers)

Brightly-colored, larger lobby: Resembles higher-end hotel, provides bang for the buck via first impression and also the sizes provides space for amenities (recreation areas, pods) to compensate for smaller rooms.

This larger lobby is a higher expense than a small lobby but is necessary to appeal to the target market via the boutique-style hotel strategy

Off-site construction: Reduce construction costs

Self-serve market area: Reduces cost by charging customers for food and beverages, some of which (coffee and tea) might otherwise be provided in-room. Craft beer seems to fit a customer profile who can't spend as much but wants a more high-end experience; differentiates from other lower-cost chains who would not have craft beer available

Not in big city centers: Saves on cost of real estate
Additionally, my general observation is that big city centers are mostly higher-end hotels, and this hotel concept is competing by outperforming lower-end hotels; therefore, a big city center location would negatively affect Tru's competitive advantage for that location

Recreation areas, pods: Compensate for smaller rooms and no desks. This also fits the cost-conscious road-trip customer, as they are less likely to be business travelers, who would have more need of desks

This is cheaper than including desks in each room, but more expensive than not offering this at all; offers a balanced approach

Smaller rooms: Reduce cost of cleaning, increase occupancy/sq ft

Smaller rooms, vinyl flooring, elimination of desks and coffee makers: Reduce cost of cleaning, eliminate cost of providing coffee in-room, reduce furniture costs

Resembles boutique brand: aesthetics are more important than room size. Could be built cheaper if did not resemble boutique brand, but that would not be in line with their overall strategy, which is to differentiate from the other low-cost hotels by offering a product that feels more high-end than its competition

Smaller hotel footprint: Reduce construction costs, land costs (smaller acreage would reduce both cost of land and property taxes)",10,"Value proposition:

* No other pricing information is given on condos in Miami Beach

* However, since it cost $480M to build and yields approx $2.7B in revenue (assuming an average price of $18M [average of $4M and $32M] x132 units), I think it is likely that they are claiming value by charging higher prices for the differentiated product",10,TRUE,1,18,4,73

[Smaller Footprint:] 

 

[Size:] The design and the size of the hotel itself will be smaller, which mean it will be cheaper, easier to maintain, monitor and clean, improve the operational efficiency.

 

 

[Location]

 

 

[Land:] Cheaper land than the mainstream locations for Hilton's typical hotels.

[Labor & Materials:] Potentialy cheaper construction employees and materials in these areas. 

[Easy Access:] There is a location trade-off. Clearly, it is not a prime location but the proximity to highways will enable easy access for customers to where they need to be for their purpurse of their travel. something that the customers will be willing to pay for in this price range.

[Labor:] Typically, in subrburns areas the labor force costs tend to be lower might enable enhancment in the UX. 

[Off-site Construction:] 

[Cost Cutting:] The chosen design allow part of the construction process to be off-site which helps cutting costs.

[Operational Efficiency] will help enable parallal work to the constructiob, hence will shorten the delivery time and as a result will increase the operational effeciency. 

[Pricing]

[Less Flashy:] The design of the rooms will be minimal and will enable to cut costs and offer the room in 100$ per night or less. About 30% of nightly demand at U.S. hotel chains in this segment is for rooms below an average of $83 a night - so the design need to support this price target. 

[Less Flashy:] With target of 100$ per night or less Tru need to extract the most out of the cutomer WTP so will improve it's offering on the shared space and the lobby offering. 

[Rooms-Lobby trade offs:]

[Economic Design:] 80% larger lobby space in compare to the competitors will enable the shared spaced to contain more bars and pods to be more utilized then normal lobby. This will be in contrast to the decrease of 20% in room space which is a significant decrease when there are large number of rooms. This is an economical use of space which will result in significant cost cutting.

[Volume:] Design increases volume of customers with smaller rooms with increased revenues. 20% decrease in room size (without table). less space and equipment in the room increase efficiecy of cleaning.

[Enhanced Loby & Services:] 80% larger space in lobby compared to the competitors, will increase the utilization of the shared space for exmple for meetings and conferences while the rooms (private space) will decrease in 20% hence the customers will be forced to work from the public shared space if needed, which will decrease the need of complex cleaning processes, and the frequency.  Smaller rooms but larger lobby with the right marketing will enable to create more value for the customers. If this will be displayed as an added value, although not private work space with table at the room but alll these added features will be valued. Focus on branding is required. ",11,"For soybean growers and customers in the herbicide market, who are dissatisfied with the spraying limitations of the Monsanto’s spray (competitor’s) product such as the drifting problem which results from evaporating off crops and drifting in the wind, which sometimes damaging neighboring crops that lack resistance to it, and disable from sparying in some time of the year when it's hot (summer time mainly).

* Would a commitment of $2.6 billion, including £200 million on U.K.-based testing and research-and-development facilities is enough to enter the market?

* What geographical markets are they planning to focus on given their competititon is big at China and US with chinese manufeturers and Tesla leading the charts? 

* What are the cost structure? Will they be sustainable given their R&D is in Europe? many of their competition has deep pockets and located in chain with typically characterized with low costs.

[Power of Buyers:]

* Brand loyaly and brand recognition, especially with Tesla brand, how would you over come their strong brand with a brand coming with expertise in Vacummes?

* What is the expected market share for Dyson if they succeed although all the barriers to be sustainable? with 109% growth rate and 6.5 M units sold in 2021,  might be great for them even if they are capturing only 1%.

* Would you be able to create trust from your customers that they can actualy drive your cars with zero cars products in your resume?

* What would be these customers willingness to pay given this is a Dyson brand? I don't know if a brand associated with vaccumes will be as attrative as Tesla which is a brand assosiated with Eylon Mask and its spaceships

* I assume the switching costs here are low expect for the brand loyaly. What are the other switching costs for exisiting users of Tesla and other competitiros (Nissan etc.) 

* Who is the target cutomer for them and how senstive to price are they? (China/US/Europe)

[Power of Suppliers:] 

Desiging and manufecturing EV requires a large vareity of suppliers. Dyson Doens't plan to partner with exisiting competitors:

* How would they design their supply chain and on which suppleir they will relay upon?

* Do they have suppliers that will coproate with them and fill in the gaps they have? 

* Are the suppliers binded to other firms that have non compete agreement? 

* What would be the power of this suppliers given the fact that Dyson will be very relient on them given their lack of experience in this industry? ",4,"Here are some questions I would like to know: 

* [Scale:] what is the scale of their cloud business? are they enjoying the benefits of economy of scale? what precentage of the market need the core cloud computing today (since that the main data we have here)? 

* [Costs:] What are their costs in R&D, advertisments, and operations? Is their costs lower relatively for the other competitiors in the same offering cloud segment? 

*  [Efficeincy:] How efficient is their operations that attributed to the cloud infrastructure? Is their technology will last for the long-run? Is it sustainable?  

* [Profits:] what is their PM? I can only see data on revenues it might be that they are not pricing well and they are actually in loss. 

Cost leadership is not deriving the lowest price in the market. The details above are around price, and revenues but I would like to know more about their costs, profits, R&D and operations to determine if they are a cost leader. It could be a case of cost competition which is not good and will just grind the value of the brand.",5,"Prosche are using differentation strategy to design their real-estate by using the same principles as the use to design their luxery cars to mainly create value and then capture some of it. 

[Creating Value:] They invest largely on creating value for the customer and stressing that the brand is not just a car but a lifestyle (like Ducati did) and creating a type of community with shared interest and brand. Here are few insights on how the increase the customers WTP without increasing the cost that same amount: 

* [Patent:] The design is so cutting edge and even uses patented car elevator. Preseting a innovative experience for the customers, creating an additonal layer of excitment and added value around the brand and it's offering. This is a smooth transition from the car lifestyle to a 360 degrees lifestyle at your home.  

* [Investment:] The developer spent relatively a large amount of $480 million to build the Porsche Design Tower, in which ten percent of the construction cost, was on the production of the Dezervator alone. This emphasis the importance Porsch puts on the brand and experience when desiging this building. This enables the car owners to gaze at it's car while they are at home, which is clearly a huge investment for this objectively non functional purpuse but int the eyes of the customer there is added value.

* [Creating a Buzz - Limited Access as a Cool Feature:] The design evolve around their car brand. For exmaple, there is no dedicated pedestrian access, to stress the centrality of the Porsche car. This is a feature that creates ""something to talk about"", isn't a functional purpouse here except for another way to increase the value in the eyes of the customers.

* [Design that Emphasis the Brand:] Visitors arrive beneath a graphite-hued archway bearing the words “Porsche Design,” and eventually gets to a high grage, as part of the added value of luxery. 

[Claiming Value:] I believe that Porsch is claiming some of the value it created by charging high prices and using the customers' WTP after creating all the value as described above compared to other buildings.

* [Price:] Prosch is pricing the apartment in relatively $4-32 million each for 132 apartments which on average will generate $2376 million, with ROI of 20% - nice return in my opinion.

* [Disclaimer:] Since I don't know details about the level and size of each apartmant in that building and the exact prices of the apartments in that area I would have to assume that they are big and fancy and well equiped but not in the worth of $4-$32 million per apartment.

In summary, I think Porsch is mainly creating value to the customer but also claim some of it (although it's not their main goal). I believe this building is part of the branding and differentiation strategy  that is part of the luexry around the brand to boost the value of Porsch Brand. ",8,TRUE,1,19,3,75.5

The rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. Rather than carpet, floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped, and in-room desks and coffee makers have been banished, also to cut down on cleaning times.

20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range, to reduce the construction and maintaince costs

Lower price ($100 or less), to attract lower end of the market than the company has typically operated

Lobby

80% larger than other than Hilton’s typical Hampton Inn location. The reason behind this decision can be to make the first experince of a new guest better (to make the hotel interior look bigger)

Brightly colored lobby, self serving option for beer and food, recreation area, individual pods where guest can work. These options will keep guests occupied and provide them addtional values. Guests can perceive the added value hence raising their WTP

Buidling

Designs that allow for some part of the construction process to be done offsite. This will reduce costs such as labour, raw materials, operating costs

Away from big cities to reduce land costs. Opening at 200 locations to increase the volume so that they can keep operating at lower margins.

 

Overall, using cost leadership, Tru is trying to reduce its overall cost more than the revenue it will generate through lower prices. ",11,"Corteva benfitted from the govt. restrictions put on the use of Dicamba. Policies around Dicamba has limited the use of Monsanto's Xtend and XtendFlex, giving Corteva an oppurtunity to capture more market share, an oppurtunity which Corteva has used by comapring their herbicide to their main competitor, Monsanto.

Following Monsanto's loosing market shares due to the Dicamba used in its herbicide, Corteva was able to provide value to the customers who had their demands unmet (being able to spray when needed, rather than not being able to during summer heat) by using a different chemical in their herbicide which did not have the same issues as Dicamba. Marketing campaings highlighting the ability to use Corteva's herbicide (such as : Corteva displayed signs that said “I have the freedom to spray"") might have helped Corteva capture more of the economic surplus by creating value and giving it to the customers.",3,"The EV market is a growing makret, with a lot of economic value available to be captured through lower of cost and raising WTP through price hikes or providing value to the consumers. Hence the main concerns or questions for Dyson will be:

* How much will be their overall cost per unit of EV? Can it be lowered through R&D or using offshore sites for labour and operations?

* How will they differentiate themsleves in the EV market? A few options can be:

* Pricing higher than the competition.

* Provide additional values in the product selling to the customers through more features in the EV, better hardware, better customer service, easy and low cost maintaince, etc.

* What is the traget customer segment and their demographic? This is a UK based company, so it might be better to target customers in the UK as this will reduce the logistics cost and also the firm will have a better understandig of the customer in the UK. Other option is China, as the volume of sales in China is maximum, hence capturing even a smaller protion of market in this country will generate good profits. US might be a tough one to crack as Tesla has dominace over this market (the last 3 top selling EVs are of Tesla and Tesla accounts for 40% of all EVs sold in the US between 2010 and 2019)

 ",5,"Oracle, by reducing its cost (infra cost, which very well might be the biggest protion of the overall cost), is trying to operate on cost leadership. But the actual cost for its infra and that for its competitors is unknown. For cost leadership to be successful the reduction in cost should reduce revenue by a lesser proportion, keep it same, or increase it, because if the revenue is lower by the same or greater proportion as the cost is, then this method is adding no value to Oracle Cloud services.

What kind of services and computational power is the Oracle CLoud is able to provide to the customers? Only lowering of price won't help if the difference between capabilites of Oracle cloud services and that of competitors is huge (oracle being the inferior one) then the customers wont be attracted to the lower price offered by Oracle.

Oracle is chepaer than the competitors, hence it is important to know if it can sustain this price in the long run, in other words, can it capture more market share by increasing its sales volume?",6,"Porsche Design Tower in Miami have adopted is a luxury service/product.

 ",5.5,"Using the SCP framework, my main areas of concern fall into: 

1. Internal efficiency: One of my biggest concerns is about Dyson's internal efficiency in producing electric vehicles. As a newcomer to the EV market, they don't currently have economies of scale, so cost control might be an issue. What are their plans to control costs and compete against incumbents that already have economies of scale? Additionally, it is unclear if Dyson has the organizational effectiveness to compete in this market. Even though they already make the components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries, there are many more elements that go into car manufacturing. Does Dyson truly have the capacity and expertise to become an Electric Vehicle manufacturer with the experience they have in household appliances, especially since they are competing with car manufacturers that have years of car-making know-how? Have they piloted this ability to ensure they can be successful before launching into such an expensive and concentrated space? 

2. Economics of demand: Although consumer demand has been growing exponentially within the EV market, Dyson needs to find a way to differentiate its EVs substantially from the competition in order to be successful. What are the ways in which it plans to create value? Will it be through a differentiation strategy that will increase customers' willingness to pay or through a cost-leadership strategy that will decrease costs for Dyson? What would those strategies be exactly and their expected quantitative data so that we can perform financial analyses that will allow us to identify an expected Internal Rate of Return and corresponding Weighted Average Cost of Capital to determine if this is a promising venture? Additionally, there is intense consumer loyalty for the existing products in the market, including Chinese manufacturers and Tesla. How does Dyson plan to combat strong consumer loyalty to other brands in order to steal market share?

3. Marketing: Dyson has already committed $2.6 billion in costs to develop their EVs, so their pricing needs to be such that they can recuperate those costs and turn a profit. What will be their pricing strategy to be both competitive against competitors' prices (who have deep pockets and thus can likely outlast Dyson if it comes to a pricing war), while also recuperating and turning a profit on costs? Additionally, Dyson needs to consider whether or not other car manufacturers already have a distribution advantage. Do they have standing contracts with distributors that will make it difficult for Dyson to break in?",7,"In order to determine if a company has a cost-leadership competitive advantage in the market, it needs to decrease its costs without decreasing consumers' willingness to pay more than that same amount. In other words, the percent by which its costs are lower than the competitors has to be greater than the percent by which its consumers' willingness to pay is lower than their competitors. At this point, we only have concrete percentage data on pricing, which can be used as a proxy to understand consumers' willingness to pay, but we do not have any data on costs and whether Oracle's costs are in fact lower by a greater percentage than the percentage by which their price is lower than their competitors' price. As such, we would need the following information to prove that Oracle has a genuine cost-leadership advantage in the market: 

1. Identify the price of a typical unit of sale across competitors (for example: the price of a single cloud subscription across competitors) 

2. Identify all the activities performed to produce that sale (all the costs that go into creating a single cloud subscription) 

3. Focus on differences in competitors' strategic choices (which activities are and are not performed, which trade-offs companies make to reduce costs or increase WTP)

4. Compare unit costs as a % of one another and price costs as a % of one another to determine if there genuinely is a cost advantage",4,"The developers of the Porsche Design Tower have adopted a dual advantage strategy, in general, in which they are both creating and claiming value. Ideally, I would like to know the percentage of the 132 units that are sold at $4 million and the percentage of units that are sold at $32 million; and most importantly, the percentage of units that were actually sold. Without this information, it is difficult to be precise about the value creation/claiming strategy (because even though they have built these units, it doesn't necessarily mean that the units have been bought; in which case this could be a complete disaster). However, I am making the assumption that all units have been sold and will be providing the metrics as a range (assuming all were sold at $4 million or all were sold at $132 million; although the truth of course lies somewhere in between).

As such, we can see that Porche has the following metrics:

* Revenue: 528 - 4,224 million 

* Profit: 48 - 3,744 million 

* Gross margin: 9-89%

* COGS as a % of sales: 11%-90% 

* Dezervator cost as a % of sales: 1-9%  

Gross margin is between 9% at its lowest (if all units were sold at $4 million) and 89% at its highest (if all units were sold at $132 million). Of course, the truth lies somewhere in between because units are a combination of all the ranges between $4-132 million. Regardless, a 9% gross margin as their lowest possible margin is still a great success. 

Most notably, the Dezervator cost is only between 1-9% of sales, an incredible feat. 

Based on this information, we can see that the Porche Design Tower developers are driving a huge wedge between WTP and costs, thus creating a high economic surplus. By pricing their units at $132 million at their highest, they are pushing the boundaries of willingness to pay and claiming value. Most importantly, one of the greatest attractions to the Porche Design Tower is the Dezervator itself, which seems to be one of the main reasons consumers are willing to pay such exorbitant prices. The Dezervator cost is only between 1-9% of sales, driving a huge wedge between costs and WTP. ",6,TRUE,1,18,4,71.5

High rivalry among existing competitors: EV market is dominated by pioneer Tesla Inc. and other major auto makers with deep pockets and years of car-making know-how. 44.5% of the current EV manufacturer market is taken by top 5 EV brands, therefore, how is Dyson going to compete with strong existing competitors? Which market is Dyson going to enter first given that China has 50% of the global EV market followed by Europe (35%)? Different markets have different sets of competitors especially in China (BYD, SAIC, and Wuling) and in U.S. (Tesla accounts for 40% of EV sales), so what is Dyson's plan to provide unique value and differentiate its EVs from the rest of the strong competition?

2. High bargaining power of buyers: Buyers of EVs have great leverage in the EV market given the abundance of existing EV options they can select from, and the EV product offerings seem undifferentiated. Which market segment is Dyson going to aim and why? I would like to know more on the market segmentation and targeting work Dyson might have done to better understand whether there is a justified underserved population or unmet need that Dyson is offering its EV to. Also, what will the price point be for Dyson's EVs? Is it going to adopt cost leadership or differentiation strategy?

3. Unclear suppliers: In terms of setting up a manufacturing facility and selling its EVs, does Dyson have any existing resources from current household appliance product lines that can overlap with its EV production and logistics?  It seems like Dyson already has some R&D capabilities to design and develop EVs and Dyson may leverage existing marketing and sales capabilities to market EVs to its potential customers, but Dyson's inbound and outbound logistics and operational capabilities (mass manufacturing) remain a concern to me. Manufacturing and shipping of household appliances should be quite different from manufacturing and shipping of EVs. Where is Dyson's manufacturing facility going to be built? Does Dyson have any existing relationship with raw material suppliers, distribution suppliers, and manufacturing and labor resources? Suppliers might have more leverage than Dyson given Dyson is new to the EV market. Those are questions I have.",7,"To determine Oracle's cost leadership competitive advantage in the market, we need to identify activities performed to produce sale of Oracle cloud infrastructure in comparison to its competition's' cost structure. Some typical cost drivers include COGS, SG&A,  R&D, IT and other operating expenses.  

Then, we need to calculate unit costs of Oracle cloud with its competitors' unit cost to identify if there is a true cost advantage. This means we need to know the total sales in units to compute the unit cost for Oracle and its competitors.

Lastly, a competitive advantage is defined by a wider wedge between customers' WTP and costs the company incurs comparing to the wedge of its competitors. Therefore, we can use the assistance of an estimate of WTP to compute total value created by Oracle in comparing to the rest of the market to see if its cost advantage, if any, is giving Oracle a true competitive advantage. I would suggest to also look at profit margin to see how much value is Oracle actually claiming when it comes to its bottom line profitability comparing to its competition. ",5,"The $480 million spent on the Porsche Design Tower with no dedicated pedestrian access signals me that the strategy the property developers for the Porsche Design Tower in Miami have adopted is definitely not a cost leadership strategy since the cost is extremely high. The extravagant design of the building and the Dezervator and the location in Miami Beach all serve together to attract people of certain wealth status who own luxury car(s) to purchase a unit of Porsche Design Tower's real estate. Therefore, the WTP of Porsche's target customer is going to be a lot higher due to the branding, the image, and the lifestyle that comes with living in the Porsche Design Tower when other people cannot afford to. Thus, this is a differentiation strategy by Porsche. 

 

In terms of value creation, which is defined by the wedge amongst between WTP and costs, I would assume yes, Porsche is creating value by driving up the WTP of its customers . Though, I need number confirmation on exactly how much the total value is created. I also assume that Porsche is claiming its value by driving up the sales price of the units in the Porsche Design Tower and benefitting from a lucrative percentage of profit. After all, not all people have the access to or can afford this luxury real estate. So yes, they are both creating value and claiming value.",7,TRUE,1,19,3,76

Can Dyson have differntiated products? 

 Assesment) I think they can't. First, It seems that their R&D investment is not enough, though they have a plan to invest $2.6 billion for the project. Competitors in the market, such as Tesla, BYD, already have invested to EV over 10 years, so Dyson need to be more aggressive to R&D area. Thisi is because, Dyson will not collaborate with other automaker, it means that dyson have to develop all the core parts, such as battery and motors,  by themselves. Even though dyson claimed that they have ""credential"" for their existing biz area, and also they have a feature of highly developed motor technology, but EV's parts other than motors are also very complex and complicated, not easy to devlelop. Also, Dyson need to consider how to overcome patent and IP issues of EV industry that big automakers already have huge kinds of patents.

 

2. Can Dyson conduct a Economy of Scale? In other words, they can effectively lower the cost?

    Assesment) Dyson need to consider start-up cost and swtiching cost first. we know that dyson is a competitive big player in home appliance mareket, but size of the automaker market is totally different. if I assume the ASP of the EV is 50 thousand dollar, the market size of EV in 2021 is 32.5 Billion dollar. Also, the plant and facilities for EV production also need huge amount of investment, it means, dyson need huge amount of entrance fee for entering this market.

The reason BYD achieves high profitability in the market is because it is integrated with their battery business. As Dyson is entering the EV market at an early stage, the amount of money invested in the production of automobile exterior materials and motors will be significant. It is believed that there will not be room to invest in batteries. There are concerns about whether long-term profitability can be secured with motor technology alone.

2. The automobile industry is a separate industry from the business group they have been in, where safety and performance must be secured at the same time rather than design and ideas. You may think that the EV uses the same principles as a putting wheels and tyres on hair dryer, but this is a mistake. The idea is to challenge new industry that is completely different from the current Dyson's DNA. I think they will have to make a lot more investments over a much longer period of time than they expect.

3. there is a concern for timing of Dyson will get into the market. The market system is already established with strong competitors.

The site selection is mainly related to cost leadership, Tru selects its hotel sites that are not popular and expensive. Tru reduces the cost of land to have cost leadership as a competitive advantage.

The design of Trus is about profit maximization and differentiation. Tru tries to get more rooms across a smaller amount of space. Through this Tru can maximize its revenue and profit within limited costs.  Also, Tru makes the hotel lobbies larger than others so that customers feel different. And it can make customers to book Tru, even though its price($100) is a little bit higher than the average($83).

The construction of hotels is associated with cost leadership. Tru enables outsourcing of certain aspects of the construction process in order to reduce costs.

Lastly, the guest services are engaged with differentiation and cost leadership. A self-serve market area provides customers with good services, and a separate section helps guests to work. And it can increase customers' willingness to pay. Also, quick cleaning and removing some items let Tru to reduce its operating costs.

1. Capabilities/Resources: Dyson's technology is based on the home appliances. So I am doubtful that Dyson has the ability to make each part of an EV car. Even though Dyson already makes high-speed motors and batteries, EV car also needs many other parts. Also, Dyson mentioned not to collaborate with other car makers. So it means that Dyson has no outsourced resources to use for making EV cars.

2. Structure: Despite Dyson developed EV cars, I have concerns about how to sell them across the world. Because EV car distribution channels are quite different from those of home appliances. So it will be very difficult and expensive for Dyson to establish its supply chain. 

3. Competitive dynamics: According to the article, I can't find Dyson's competitive advantages. To compete with existing big companies, Dyson should have a cost leadership or differentiation strategy. If Dyson does not have competitive advantages, Dyson can't survive in the EV car market. Because the rivalry among competitors will get intense, new entrants will join this market.  ",6,"I think two things are needed to certify that Oracles' cloud infrastructure business has cost leadership. 

First, I need to prove how Oracle lowered its price. If Oracle lowers the price based on its cost reduction, we can say that Oracle has a competitive advantage because Oracle creates value through cost reduction. But if Oracle just lowers the price to expand its market share, it is not a competitive advantage. It is just a shift within value, from Oracle to customers. 

Second, I need to know if other competitors, such as Microsoft, Google, and Alibaba, can lower their prices too. Because when competitors follow Oracles's strategy, its revenue and market share will fall. So, it means that Oracle's price strategy is not unique and sustainable.  

To analyze these concerns I need to check Oracle and other competitors' price and cost structure. Also, I need to find customers' willingness to pay by survey or other methods.",4,"I think they can do both, creating value and claiming value. 

1. Creating value: Porche is well known for its supercars and has a reputation for luxury and fashion. So the luxury condominium made by Porche can increase consumers' willingness to pay. Because customers can think the Porsche Design Tower has distinguishable features compared to existing luxury buildings. For example, the Dezervator is one of the differentiation.  

2. Claiming value: Even though the Porsche Design Tower has a differentiated value, customers might not think that its value has not increased. It can be just one of the luxury buildings. So the customer's willingness to pay will not change. So if the price is higher than WTP, people will buy or live in others instead of the Porche Design Tower.

To summarize, it depends on customers' willingness to pay. ",7,TRUE,1,21,1,80

1: It seems very experience for Dyson to solely use its 'credentials' to enable them to compete effectively. They have an exceptional reputation in the household market, however, most customers are not aware of their achievements in the battery field. How much would they need to spend on the mareting activity? Personally, I believe it will be much cheaper if they collaborate with existing players.

2: EV is a heavily investment industry to enter, Is £2bn sufficient for Dyson to establish their EV base? 

3: 'Creditials' sounds very unclear, what will be Dyson's competitive advantage in this market? BYD is famously for cost leadership and Tesla grabs the maret share through its differentiation strategy. What would be Dyson's go-to- market strategy? How can they compete effectively?

Dyson seems to enjoy an advantage in its capability in innovation and high-speed motor & batteries, providing it differentiation point when officially coming into the EV market. By producing its own battery, Dyson greatly mitigates the supplier threat.

The EV market has a) low level of entry threat, since it requires heavy capital investment b) high level of substitutes threat, as most customers still drive conventional gas-fuelled vehicles c) high level of competition, major players are Tesla, BYD, and Big Three automakers, but there are many small players in the industry and there is potential for them to consolidate and compete d) low level power of suppliers since most of the players produce their own batteries e) moderate buyer power as the product is not very differentiated.",7,"* Topline performance: how much revenue and market share does Oracle have compared to other players in this industry?

Choice 1

Make the rooms smaller - focus only on what is essential in the room to reduce costs. Supports the value proposition to the consumer.

Allow some parts of the hotel to be built offsite - allows for lower costs and streamlining of certain products in the hotel - hopefullly reducing costs

Rooms are 20% smaller, so cleaning the rooms is much faster - lower cleaning costs, the lower room price for the customer.

Choice 2

Make the lobby big and bright - to compensate for the smaller rooms, have a big lobby - differentiates from competitors small and dim lobbies

Focus on markets where land is cheap and plentiful - allows developers to hit their margins - and focuses on the lower-to-middle quartile WTP consumers, which is the target customer segment

Floors are made of vinyl so they can be mopped - again leading to quicker cleaning times and lower cleaning costs - allowing lower room costs.

Choice 3

No desks or in-room coffee makers - again, focusing on what is essential in the room to reduce costs and allow a lower price for customers. 

Focusing on less populated areas should help reduce construction costs by having cheaper labor, less costly building equipment, and more efficient building processess (not having to navigate through sky-scrapers, massive traffic, etc.).

Recreational areas and work areas in the lobby allow for a more lively guest experience in the lobby than a traditional low-priced inn. Contributes to the value proposition to the customer.

Choice 4

Make the lobby a place where people come to work, eat, drink, and have reacreational activities. This is a key differentiator for Hilton in their value proposition to customers.

Focusing on less-served/less populated areas should allow developers that can't afford to operate in major cities to be able to get contracts, hopefully reducing costs and therefore room prices for the customer. 

Having more recreational areas (working out, games, work spaces) will differentiate this lower-priced offering from similar lower-priced hotels, and will fit the value proposition of a lively, fun place to stay in a smaller market that is affordable and high quality.",11,"For customers in the soybean seed + herbicide market, who are dissastisfied with the spraying limitations of Monsanto's products resulting from their incorporation of Dicamba in their products, our offering, Enlist E3, provides an unrestrained soybean and spray for your farm at an affordable price. Buy now!",7,"Three most critical areas of concern:

1) Cost - developing a functioning electric vehicle at scale is enormously expensive. Although Dyson has committed $2.6 billion, this would be just the beginning of the on-going costs to develop working prototypes, hire enough engineering talent (surely Dyson won't be able to only use its hair-dryer, vacuum cleaner, and hand dryer engineers) and spend on advertising to get consumers even aware of your car, much less actually buy it. I am also concerned with how this undertaking would affect the entire balance sheet of the company. 

2) The competitve dynamics of the EV market. The EV market is incredibly competitive, and producers of EVs have shown that they are willing to pull every trick in the book to attempt to increase share - slash prices, produce at a loss, etc. Aside from ""But Dyson has made a mark around the globe by fusing innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances such as vacuum cleaners, fans and hand dryers,""  what would differentitate Dyson from everyone else?Tesla, BYD, Volkswagen, etc. all have some of the brightest engineers in the world working on this specific type of vehicle. What components of Dyson's company structure would allow them to produce EVs at profit within a reasonable time frame and without massive capital spending? What SPECIFICALLY does Dyson have that would allow them to differentiate themselves from these competitors? In my view, nothing.

3) Company resources - in a company's resource based advantages, one of the tests is whether dyson's capabilities are extensible into new business areas. While Dyson has shown incredible success in their various product mixes, I am incredibly skeptical of Dyson being able to translate this success into the EV market. The company is set up to manufacture, distribute and sell hair and hand dryers - the translation into EVs seems outlandish. The company would likely have to build new factories, hire new engineers, develop a new balance sheet, advertise to consumers, and everything else that an EV needs to do to sell vehicles. I do not see a compelling reason, given the information, for Dyson to enter this market. ",6,"To prove that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a geniune cost leadership competitive advantage, you would need to prove that, for similar services, Oracle's product is cheaper than the competitors. You could prove this by anayzing the gross, operating and net margins of Oracle's cloud business versus its competitors (assuming that information is available), the cost structure of the company (is it spending highly on R&D and SG&A, or is it minimizing these expenses and passing the savings on to consumers?) and its competitors, and by analyzing the product mix of Oracle and its competitors. Once you performed this analysis, it would be wise to look at trend data for market share for each type of cloud infrastructure product to determine whether this strategy is increasing market share or losing it. This could indicate whether Oracle is in fact a cost leader, or whether Oracle is simply a very cheap product because of bad quality and service. It is critical to use empirical evidence whenever it is available.",10,"The Porsche tower is clearly pursuing a differentiation strategy. And it is clearly working. 132 units x 4 million (minimum unit cost) = 528m, whereas the development cost was a total of 480m (I'm assuming this includes the cost of everything to build this tower). This implies a minimum profit margin of (48/480) of 10%, but when taking into consideration the fact that some units sell for as high as 32 million, the true figure is likely much, much higher. Therefore, Porsche is both CREATING and CAPTURING the value in this piece of branded real estate. It is likely that there is highly specific segment of Porsche owners (or car enthusiasts in general), who have a very high WTP for features such as the Dezervator, which are basically not available anywhere else (until the competition comes, of course!) ",7,TRUE,1,18,4,78

* Dyson's reported resource is their organizational capability around building crucial EV components such as high-speed motors and batteries. However, it is difficult to assess whether this grants them a resource-based advantage against their competitors. I surmise that even if the high-speed motors Dyson builds may be a resource, it is likely easy to copy without added investment and only only constitutes a small portion of the EV. 

* The second exhibit shows a variety of players in the EV market with differentiated styles, performance, and capabilities. Dyson may have an opportunity to enter a segment, but we will need to assess their entry value for their selected buyer group whether it be features such as performance, safety, or economy. As a new entrant into the EV space, creating loyalty may be a challenge, but leading with a differentiated advantage that mitigates the pain points of the EV industry (e.g. slow charge time) will be imperative.

* 2.6 billion dollars is a massive investment. Dyson may be seeking to capitalize on the 109% growth to continue past their launch. I would like to assess the market's future expectation for growth, Dyson's cost structure to surmise their profitability and cost-leadership strategy, and their break-even market share.",7,"Since cloud computing is about giving computer space to users online, to certify Oracle's cost-leadership advantage in the market, we will need to know whether Oracle is able to bring their costs down for their selected users in relation to their competitors. Here, I will only investigate the costs and services associated with users accesing the infrastructure layer.

* For infrastructure usage: This can include electricity costs, internet/bandwidth costs, hardware efficiency. I would hypothesize that electricity and hardware are likely similar in per-service costs across the industry, but it would be interesting to see if Oracle is targeting a lower-volume user group such as startups or mid-sized companies with less data to store-transfer-compute to reduce the variable cost per contract.

* For infrastructure service: Service charges can include in-person help desks, product integrations, and setup charges. These fees will likely take more human capital and will be expensive, and is likely similar in cost per employee across the industry. To investigate their cost leadership I would see their how Oracle would attempt to reduce their service rates by looking at R&D investments (e.g. reducing user friction or streamlining onboarding to be an web-only) and reduction of SG&A (or anywhere they choose to stick their employee costs) to see if they reduced their human capital costs overall.",1,"Value Creation: To see whether we are truly creating value, we will need to assess their sales volume since introduction. However, from the information given, it seems that Porsche is attempting to create value for the customer by exending their lifestyle brand into the 'living' experience of a car fanatic. The car elevator, Porsche's brand design, ability to have the car in your home all serve as a valuable experiences for the customer. This seems like a fantastic lifestyle for high-rolling european football players like Cristiano Ronaldo.

Value Capture: To see whether we are claiming value, we need to see whether their pricing is approaching their willingness to pay beyond their costs. Assuming a straight average price of $18 million dollars a unit, the Porsche tower will need to sell at least 27 units (20%) to cover at least their development costs. They would likely be claiming additional value as they further occupy their remaining units.",6,TRUE,1,16,6,58

By choosing location like Farmville, Va., and Cheyenne, Wyo, Tru targets less-flashy cities off of suburban highway exits to keep land costs lows and therefore, costs for customers down.

Furthermore, the guest rooms have vinyl flooring and don't have additional items like desks and coffee machines to cut down on cleaning time and costs.

In order to deliver substantial returns to developers, Tru focused on reducing the property size, while increasing room count, as well as offloading construction to offsite.

Tru has a self-serve market area and a larger lobby to offset the lack of traditional guest services found in hotels.",9,"For farmers and growers, who are dissatisfied with the drawbacks of the drift associated with dicamba and, therefore, the restrictions on spraying. Corteva's Enlist E3 provides farmers with an herbicide that's powerful enough to kill persistent weeds, with the convenience of spray and peace of mind. ",4.5,"1. Does Dyson have the ability to create value for EV car customers within its existing value chain or will it need to create a new value chain to succeed in its market entry strategy? Although Dyson has incredible experience creating value for its customers across smaller electronic products such as hair dryers, vacuums, fans, etc, it will be interesting to see if Dyson can continue to create value in an industry that requires large CapEx and car-making expertise to optimize manufacturing. Dyson may be able to leverage its initial experience creating high-speed motors and batteries, which are critical for EV cars, as an entry point into building out further processes. However, it will need to negotiate contracts with suppliers, who may have high supplier power depending on how ""niche"" the processes are and the total number of suppliers. 

2. As a UK brand, can Dyson grow the market cap for the entire UK EV market or will need to enter the US EV market to have a successful market entry strategy? Dyson already competes in the US market for smaller electronic products, however, it will be interesting to see if Dyson can as easily enter the US EV market. Currently, the US EV market is the 2nd largest EV market, but still trails behind China's market; the UK market is minuscule in comparison. Therefore, Dyson will need to decide if it wants to compete with the ""big dogs"" in the US market, which is dominated by Tesla, but otherwise fragmented by smaller players, or if it believes its market entry strategy in the UK can push sales up with a first-to-market approach.

3. Will Dyson pursue a differentiation strategy or a cost-leadership strategy? Based on Dyson's previous innovations within the small electronic products group, Dyson has pursued a differentiation strategy, by creating value for its customer and then claiming it. In the EV market, however, Tesla has already pursued a differentiation strategy relative to its competitors. Therefore, Dyson will need to decide if it can grow a niche, highly differentiated EV car that can 'compete' with Tesla but ideally serves a different target customer. In order to do so, Dyson may have even higher margins than Tesla but will need to willingly forego potential market share gains, as a result. ",7,"In order to determine if Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost-leadership competitive advantage in the market, we will need additional information on its financial data. Specifically, we will need to do a margin analysis on the cost structure component and look at COGS %/sales and SG&A %/sales. We will need to understand where is Oracle reducing costs across the value chain, whether it is in primary activities such operations, marketing & sales, or service, or if it is in support activities such as procurement and firm infrastructure. We would then need to benchmark these statistics across market data for competitors like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to fully understand where is it cutting cost across the value chain to afford cheaper prices by 61% in comparison to AWS and by 38% for Google. Furthermore, we can understand where competitors are spending more and potentially creating and claiming more value compared to Oracle. Additionally, we will need to take a closer look at market share data, as Oracle's revenue have grown by 66% and holds 2% of the total cloud mark cap, and zoom into if Oracle is grabbing market share from competitors or growing market cap overall to serve customers who were previously not catered to. ",10,"Porsche is creating value through a differentiation strategy and gaining a competitive advantage through increasing its customers' willingness-to-pay. In terms of their generic strategy to create value across the value chain, Porsche made certain decisions that would increase its cost to develop but then be able to partially claim that value through increased prices. For example, it spent 10% of its development costs on the Dezervator, which provides value for its customers in terms of extravagance and beauty within the home. If Porsche were to completely claim value of the Dezervator at the Porsche Tower, it would price a majority of its units at the higher end, pushing its customers' willingness-to-pay. We do not know the spread of what each unit costs, however, since Porsche does offer ""cheaper"" units at $4 million, we can think that Porsche is creating value for all customers but not claiming it for all. If the condominium market continues to grow by the projected 12%, Porsche will need to decide the ratio in which distributes its pricing, across low and high priced units, to determine whether it will place emphasis on sheer value creation or if it seeks to claim all of it as well. ",10,TRUE,1,15,7,68.5

Choice 1

rethink the design to get more rooms across a smaller amount of space (more revenue)

They aimed at less-flashy locales like suburban highway exits. The first Tru by Hilton hotel was built in Oklahoma City, which result in decreasing in rent fee

lobby that is more than 80% larger than Hilton’s typical Hampton Inn location (cost might be increasing but they increase more amount of customer's WTP)

Choice 2

designs that allow for some part of the construction process to be done offsite

The rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. (floors covered in vinyl that can be mopped, and in-room desks and coffee makers have been banished) Lowering operation cost

The brightly-colored lobbies have a self-serve market area where guests can get drinks like Craft beer and food, and also boasts recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work

Choice 3

The overall footprint of the property is smaller, too, and will largely be away from big-city centers, keeping land costs down

Choice 4",11,"For Corteva, who is dissatisfied with current fierce competition with Mosanto in the soybean seeds and herbicide market, their soybean-and-spray combination product called E3 will offer them value and competitive advantage in the market in respective of its less adverse effect for the crops. 

To specify, their competitor Mosanto's equivalent product uses Dicamba. Dicamba has more adverse effect of evaporating off crops and drift in the wind, and damaging neighboring crops. Increasing number of farmers were fearful of liability that came along with the spray with Dicamba, which will decrease the demand for Mosanto's dicamba spray. Some states placed restrictions on Mosanto's prary. As an effect, Corteva has been able to gain market share from Mosanto as a perfect substitute. ",2.5,"Firstly, Dyson's capabilities and resources are as below:

Dyson commit £2 billion ($2.6 billion) to the project, including £200 million on U.K.-based testing and research-and-development facilities.

They already made components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries. Its teams in Singapore have made 50 million high-speed digital motors, an essential element of electric cars. and their capabilities seem to be innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances such as vacuum cleaners, fans and hand dryers.

 

However, I would like to address three areas of concern regarding Dyson's new EV market entry strategy.

 

1. Network effect: among the incumbents, traditional gasoline/diesel based companies (VW, BMW, Hyundai Motor Group) can enjoy the network effect. To specify, they already owned required facilities (R&D center, dealership networks, afterservice workshops), accumulated customer data (car buyers), which they can utilize for the EV market. Likewise, big EV players such as Tesla and BYD already had their networks/facilities and enjoyed it. Moreover, growing number of EV manufacturers are combined (e.g. Joint Ventures) to build on battery by themselves to reduce cost and increase efficiency by taking comparative advantage. However, Dyson as a newcomer does not have the network at the beginning. Moreover, Dyson's strategy not to collaborate with other car makers can be risky as an new comer in the market. This will lead to huge spending at the beginning. 

 

2. Customer Loyalty: customer loyalty is crucial in EV industry, likewise other automotive industry. Customer's demand can be decided through their loyalty towards the brand. e.g. Tesla - innovative, AI Driven, BMW - sheer driving pleasure, safety, Hyundai Motor Group - Efficient, family-use. and this loyalty is usually built over time.  

Dyson is renowned as home appliance company. Thus, customers do not have loyalty of their brand in the EV market, which will decrease their competitiveness in the market. 

And I am not certain that if Dyson has strong brand loyalty in China, if they need to penetrate into the Chinese EV market.  

 

3. Economies of scale: As EV market belonged to the automotive industry, it, to be a competitive global EV player, needs to exceed a certain amount of sales to exceed the BEP. Presumably guessing the number of car sold to reach the BEP should be over 1 million cars, I am doubtful if Dyson can reach the economies of scale by selling that amount of car. (Concerning their brand loyalty in the EV market). ",5,"To regard that Oracle's cloud infrastructure has a genuine cost leadership advantage in the market,

we need to see the profit of the Oracle's cloud infrastructure by comparing the WTP, price and the cost. 

Cost leadership advantage is gained when the amount of cost decrease is greater than the amount of WTP decrease.

In other words, profit should be greater in order to gain cost leadership advantage. 

If Oracle's profit is decreasing over time, this is not a cost leadership advantage and they are decreasing the value of their service by lowering the cost. 

In this case, the increased revenue is not ideal. In the long term, if any of incumbents started price war by discounting price, Oracle will significantly lose their market share. ",1,"By implementing Porsche design and Dezervator into the building, the developers are creating more values. 

They believe by value adding strategy, customers' willingness to pay for this luxury condominium will increase more than the amount of cost increases.

Just looking into the Dezervator's cost, this was $48 million (10% of the construction cost of the building), which seems to be huge. 

However, developers' assume this is value adding to their building, and increase the WTP of the customers.

I suppose this construction fees are blended into the unit fees (4 to 32 million USD) and the developers will enjoy the profit afterwards. 

The residents would enjoy privilege of living in this luxury building with the Porsche design features, and they are willing to pay more than the market rent fees. Moreover, this branded real estate will potentially increase their building value, which will give more economic fortunes to the both developers and residents. ",5,TRUE,1,19,3,64.5

Smaller guest rooms

These smaller rooms were designed to take less time to clean (i.e. vinyl floors instead of carpets). This allows staff to clean more rooms within an allowed for time, saving on labor costs. This is part of a cost leadership strategy.

Decreasing the size of guest rooms by 20% from the average allows for a higher volume of customers, increasing revenue. This also allows Tru to increase their market share of hotel guests.

By decreasing the size of rooms, Tru can increase the number of rooms and offer them at a lower price to customers.

Smaller properties away from city centers

The use of smaller guest rooms means that Tru does not need as much land for each of its hotels. This in turns cuts down on costs for Tru, as part of a cost leadership competitive advantage strategy.

Constructing hotels with a smaller footprint in areas where land costs are cheaper acts as a cost-saving measure for Tru. This is part of a cost leadership competitive advantage strategy.

These property choices allow Hilton to serve customers with unmet needs. That is, customers who want a Hilton-quality hotel at affordable prices.

Some building construction done offsite

Tru can design a low-cost hotel to mitigate design/construction costs in their cost structure.

This choice lowers construction costs, allowing Tru to operate on a low-cost strategy.

By lowering costs, Tru can pass its savings on to its customers.

Larger lobbies with various amenities

Increasing the lobby size and filling it with amenities compensates for the lack of room/amenities within guest rooms. (For example, guests don't have a desk in their room to work, but can use work pods in the lobby).

Putting amenities (work pods, market area, recreation area) in the lobby allows Hilton to include these features at a cost-efficient price. Tru can pass these savings on to customers.

Although guest rooms may be minimal, Tru creates value for its customers by providing various amenities in its hotel lobby. Guests can feel that they have a full top-level Hilton experience at Tru prices. For example, they have easy access to great food, right in the lobby.",10,"Corteva's Enlist E3 is for soybean farmers who are dissatisfied with the headaches, liability, and restrictions related to dicamba drift; our offering provides an equally effective weedkiller without dicamba drift and therefore without spraying limitations at a competitive price.

Corteva has been able to gain market share from Monsanto by creating additional value for their customers. Both Monsanto and Corteva products act as an effective weed killer. However, Corteva goes beyond that and eliminates the need for customers to deal with weed killer restrictions. Corteva Enlist E3 is positioned as an effective weedkiller that goes one step further than its competition--it actually makes farmers' lives easier. It does this by giving farmers fewer things to worry about (i.e. liabilities related to dicamba, spraying restrictions).",7.5,"1. I would have questions about how Dyson planned to overcome a high new entry barrier in the EV market. Entering the EV market requires a large up-front capital investment (upwards of $2.6 billion). I would need to review financial projections/IRR for this project to see if it is worth the large start-up cost. I would also be concerned that Dyson will take a lot of work on branding for the average consumer to associate it with electric cars. Additionally, Dyson is banking on its previous innovative engineering work in small appliances and existing access to car components as proof that it is able to easily switch into the EV market. However, I would have concerns that despite this there will still be a significant learning curve for Dyson to properly compete in the EV market.

2. I would be concerned about the high competitive rivalry Dyson will face in the EV industry. The EV market is a relatively concentrated industry, with a few large firms dominating the field. In fact, the top 5 EV brands alone capturing about 44.5% of market sales. These companies also have had plenty of time to develop their manufacturing ""know-how"" since they came to market long before Dyson. Combining this with the high fixed cost base required to enter the EV market, I would be concerned about how Dyson plans to address this high level of competitive rivalry.

3. The third concern I would have for Dyson is if it has the organizational capability to enter the EV market. Dyson may have technological components of EVs already available, but it has never been tasked as an organization to compile said components to create a fully functioning vehicle. Tesla, by comparison, sold about 40% of all EVs purchased in the US between 2010-2019. Tesla clearly has developed an effective organization capability to get EVs out to the US market. Dyson, on the other hand, will have to make changes to its organizational structure to account for its entry into this new market. ",6,"In order to prove that Oracle has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage I would need to look at a variety of financial and market data to verify. First, I would need to evaluate a side-by-side cost structure comparison for Oracle, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. I would need to see that Oracle's underlying costs (i.e. COGS, SG&A) as a percent of product sale price are in fact less than its competition. I would also want to evaluate pricing data across the industry, to prove that Oracle's price comparison claims for its products are in fact accurate and that they do price below industry standard. I would also like to look at the market share division between players in the cloud infrastructure industry. If Oracle has a cost leadership advantage, then I should ideally see that Oracle is gaining a significant portion of the market over time. That is, if it has a successful cost leadership advantage I should see numbers that reflect Oracle capturing market volume of customers year-over-year.",10,"The developers for the Porsche Design Tower are both creating more value for their customers and claiming more value for their customers. They are claiming value by charging high prices for their condominium units (priced at $4-$32 million each), which is higher than a standard Miami condominium unit. This statement assumes that the tower development project was always going to cost a set amount in order to deliver such a high quality building. These incredibly high prices remain within a certain customer set's WTP. The developers are also creating value for customers through a differentiation strategy. One of the main selling points of this building is the Dezervator. This is a patented design, meaning that customers will not be able to find it anywhere else. There are likely customers who are willing to pay a higher price/have a higher WTP for a condominium unit simply to have access to the Dezervator. Living in this building also provides this subset of customers with a high social status that they are likely seeking as well. The building does not have easy pedestrian access, indicating that it is designed to keep the ""common"" population out.",7,TRUE,1,19,3,80.5

Choice 1

Rooms are 20% smaller which reduces costs and time to clean. The hotel can employ less cleaning staff.

Some production services are conducted off-site which lowers costs

Larger lobby area to create a more social atmosphere that aims to draw customers towards the bar and food areas. Different streams of income within the hotel have huge potential to increase revenue.

Choice 2

Replaced carpets with vinyl that make it easier to clean.

Property size is smaller which reduces maintenance costs, lowers property taxes.

Work cubbies placed in the lobby also place the customer in close proximity to the food and bar area which will hopefully result in them buying products. Worjk cubbies also draw working professionals who likely have disposible income.

Choice 3

Eliminated coffee makers and in room desks which saves time to clean. This also influences the customer to go to the lobby and spend money at the bar/restaurant.

Hotels are built in suburban areas near highway exits. This targets travellers and people who are wanting and expecting a lower price hotel.

Overall less services reduces the margin for error across the board. The company can place more emphasis, time, and attention to the areas that matter the most to them.

Choice 4

Tru is entering the largest market in the hotel industry. Creating a competitive advantage in this industry offers a large potential for high revenues.

Self-serve markets reduce the need to staff restaurants and bars. This reduces overhead costs.",11,"Corteva has found a competitive advantage against its main competitor, Monsanto. Their value proposition for the Enlist E3 product is that Enlist E3 is for farmers worried about Monsanto's dicamba drifting onto their adjacent crops and damaging them. Corteva's offering provides an alternative tested by agricultural researchers that does not drift towards other crops, thus not damaging them resulting in higher crop yields. The cease of drift also virtually eliminates the headaches some state's governments have placed on the use of dicamba.

The information provided does not mention the price Corteva is charging for its product, but we can deduce that the farmer's will both save money and time from using or switching to Corteva's product. Farmers will likely prefer Corteva's product because it reduces overall risk to their other crops, provides an alternative to government restrictions, and they are dissatisfied with Monsanto's current offering.

Corteva currently has an advantage, but Monsanto can quickly make up ground in the market. 2,4-D Choline is likely not a patentable or rare product so Corteva cannot compete on resources.. A company the size of Monsanto can quickly change their manufacturing and supporting sales process to offer a new product. The main advantage Corteva has is their current positioning as the main 2,4-D Choline supplier and strategic marketing strategies to gain as much market share as possible.",4,"1. Knowledge gap. My main concern for Dyson is the knowledge gap from producing household appliances to electric vehicles. I am confident that their engineers have the capacity to learn how to build and create electric vehicles. The concern is that this takes time. The engineers may require years of learning and trial and error to become competant electric vehicle engineers. Current electric vehicle engineers may not want to leave their current roles at the big players like Tesla, Volkswagon, Toyota, etc. While Dyson's engineers are learning how to build electric vehicles, their competitors are actually producing and selling EVs. Dyson can lure current EV engineers from competitors with higher salaries and creative leeway. Dyson does have credentials in innovation which may be attractive to engineers.

2. Customer perception. When I read the first sentence I immediately was skeptical that of Dyson choosing to make EVs. They are taking a huge risk in entering a market that they have no prior history in. They need to invest heavily in marketing and convincing the public that Dyson produces quality EVs as good as or better than other EV makers. I would suggest a differentiation strategy where they offer EVs at a higher price but with a greater perceived benefit. Dyson's current household appliance strategy relies on differentiation. I would not argue that Dyson make the best vaccuum on the market.

3. Competition. In Europe, their main competitors appear to be Tesla with 35% market share and likely Volkswagon since it is a European car manufacturer. The European market produces far less EVs when compared to China and the United States. Dyson needs to pursue a capture approach focused on customer acquistion and innovation. Dyson can target European customers by highlighting that they are in fact a European company. They can play on identity and lure European customers away from Tesla. Their innovative mindset is also an advantage that can gain market share by offering items that are better than their competitors.

Overall, I believe Dyson has a long road ahead of them. They need to broaden their plan from relying solely on their previous credentials and convince their potential customers why their EV is better.",7,"Oracle is competing on a cost leadership approach by offering a similar product compared to its competitors at a lower price. In order to prove that their cost leadership competitve advantage is viable, I would want to access a few areas. First, their price point is much lower than their competitors. I am intrigued on how they are able to justify their prices. We would need to look at all the activities that drive sales and their costs. The value chain of Oracle is important to understand because they may have found a competitive advantage in certain steps or a combination of supporting activities.

When it comes to financials, I would want to know what the customer is actually buying from Oracle. Does Oracle offer individual products and services or a full package. A customer may only need a few cloud offerings or subscriptions. AWS and others may offer full packages and support services with no customization. Other important financials to understand are their profit margins, asset turnover rates, and its financial leverage. Is Oracle foregoing spending in other internal functions to justify reduced costs? Have they found a way run their operations in a leaner, more cost efficient manner?

If Oracle is offering a lower price they likely have low profit margins. This needs to be carefully analyzed and managed to be sustainable. They are not gaining marketing share in the overall industry so that makes me believe they have a high market share of a niche industry.

We also need to look at their target customer. Oracle has only captured 2% of total cloud revenue. I would like to see their value proposition statement and the list of customers they sell their product to. A 2% share indicates to me that they are selling their product to a niche industry that allows them reduce costs. The customer of AWS, Google, etc. probably costs those companies more to sell to and support.",4,"The Porsche Tower is a very unique example of creating value in a niche market. I see the tower as a complement to the Porsche lifestyle and the cars. The company and developers are claiming value rather than creating it.

I would argue that the company is not creating value because they are not evolving the luxury apartment industry. The apartments are still very expensive and they are not highlighting the apartments themselves. The company's strategy is based off of exclusivity. The buyers can likely go to any other luxury apartment in Miami but the Porsche tower plays to their identity.

There is no pedestrian access which denies entry to those that do not live there. You have to have the status of owning the apartment to enter. The Dezervator also does not add value. It simply provides an outlet to show off your Porsche. The Dezervator does not add value to parking your vehicle. Both regular apartment complex parking and Dezervator parking is free parking at the end of the day.

The company and developers already in essence have captured the customer because the people who buy the apartments are going to be Porsche owners. They developed the look of the building to replicate the sleekness of the car. The denial of accessibility is reminiscent of the high cost barrier of the Porsche to regular people.

They are competing on a differentation strategy compared to the other luxury apartments in Miami by creating a perceived higher benefit and status to live there. Their customer's WTP is clearly high.",5,TRUE,1,15,7,59

Suburban location: By choosing to open Tru in suburban locations and smaller towns, instead of in major cities, Hilton has a cost advantage over competitors.  

Hilton's decision to enter the lower end of the hotel market, but to do so in a way that makes it stand out from Best Western and Quality Inn is a differentiation advantage. 

The decision to construct components of Tru hotels offsite is a cost advantage. Hilton made this choice because it knows it is difficult to convince developers it can deliver sufficient returns on properties in the sub $100 per night price range. 

The choice to  remove features like in-room desks and coffee makers drives more efficiency for Tru and creates a cost advantage in the process. 

The choice to make rooms 20% smaller is a cost advantage for Tru. Smaller rooms are a part of keeping the overall square footage of each location lower, which is a cost advantage. 

80% larger lobbies that include a self-serve market area where guests can get drinks and food,  recreation areas, and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work, are all part of a differentiation advantage for Tru. These are unique features to Tru hotels that differentiate it in the market. ",10,"Value Proposition Statement:

For farmers who are dissatisfied with (or inhibited by regulations on) Monsanto's Xtend and XtendFlex soybean spray products, Corteva's offering, ""Enlist E3"", provides crop protection without the evaporative effects of Dicamba (used in Xtend and Xtend Flex), at a comparable price. 

 

Additional Context:

Corteva's value proposition directly contrasts its product from Monsanto's products. Corteva has a differentiation advantage in the market, offering a product with unique benefits that the rival competitor does not offer.  The value proposition does not include a cost advantage, so this is why I have said that Enlist E3 is at a comparable price. We were not provided with information about pricing, so one can assume the products are priced similarly and product features are what make Corteva's product superior. ",7,"1) Dyson's ability to differentiate itself in the EV market: The EV market is already crowded, with several legacy car manufacturers and exclusive EV producers in the market. I am concerned about Dyson's ability to develop an EV that is a unique or differentiated offering. While Dyson has been innovative in the small appliances market, I am not sure the series of choices it has made to do so will translate over to the EV market. Dyson has to offer a superior user experience, leaning into vehicle performance, passenger comfort, or desirable in-cabin technology features.  I am concerned about whether Dyson's resources and capabilities as a company will allow it to differentiate its EV product in one (or multiple) of these three ways.  Tesla already offers several of these features in the U.S. market and VW and BYD do so in the European and Asian markets.

2) Dyson's ability to meet manufacturing targets: We have seen several other EV makers struggle to meet their production targets (Tesla, Rivian, etc.) These car makers have are more established players in the market, but have still not been able to produce vehicles as quickly as they would hope to. I am concerned about Dyson's ability to build an efficient supply chain and operating model for its EV. EVs require hundreds of parts and as a new player entering the market, Dyson will have to quickly source product and begin assembling vehicles to meet its goal of having an EV ready for sale by 2026. I would need to understand Dyson's current capabilities and available resources to determine whether it can meet manufacturing goals and successfully enter the EV market. 

3) Dyson's ability to grow in the EV market: Even if Dyson offers a differentiated product and manages to meet its manufacturing targets, I am not sure if Dyson can maintain a steady stream of consumers and grow revenue year after year. Because the market is so crowded, it will be difficult for a new player (especially one with no car manufacturing experience) to enter the market and take significant market share from well established competitors. I would need to see how Dyson plans to market, price, and grow its product offering to determine if they can be successful in the EV market. ",6,"I would need to be able to prove Oracle has an advantage in all, or most of the following areas over its competitors. Therefore, I would need the data for Oracle and its major competitors: 

Gross Margin, Operating Margin, COGS, SGA

Avg. Selling Price, Target Customer 

Sales Growth Rate, Total market share over the last five to ten years, and the growth rate of each company's margin. 

 

These elements would allow me determine if Oracle truly has a cost leadership based competitive advantage in the market, or whether its low prices are simply a revenue driver and not a true competitive advantage. ",8,"Porsche has both created value and captured value with the Porsche Design Tower. The total cost of the tower is $480M and the units in the tower range from $4M-$32M. There are 132 units. Even if every unit in the building was $4M, Porsche would still make $528M in revenue. It would have a profit of $48M, or 10%. Considering the average price of units must be much higher than $4M, Porsche has created value, because the willingness to pay for units in the Porsche Tower is much higher than the cost of building the tower. 

Additionally, the luxury condominium business is growing at a rate of 12% per year. Porsche is capturing some of this value by offering a product that targets a very specific consumer in the market-a car fanatic. The target customer is a wealthy individual who values luxury real estate AND sports cars (specifically Porsches). Porsche has determined this consumer has a high willingness to pay for a highly experiential condominium experience.

To ensure that they can make profits while charging $100, they have designed the room smaller and easier to clean - which help them reduce the space required for each room and add more rooms on each floor plus reduce the cleaning times and thereby the cleaning costs. Also, they are designing larger lobby area to attract more customers and balance out the smaller size of the room. 

Construction: Again, everything here is done to reduce the costs as much as possible starting from trying to keep some parts of the construction off site to reduce the costs and doing mass productions. Lastly, they have constructed the rooms and furniture in a way that can reduce the cleaning time and thereby the costs. 

Guest Services: Guest services are provided in the lobby to attract the customers to the lobby. The lobby area is much larger and provides food, recreations and work area, all of which will ensure that the customers hang out more in the lobby and Hilton can compensate for the smaller room size. 

All in all, Hilton is trying to enter a lower price segment in the hotel business, where although they are designing the rooms smaller than the competitiors, they are ensuring that they compensate for it by the Guest services in the larger lobby. Also, Hilton is keeping the costs in check to enusre that Hilton generates sufficient returns.",11,"Value Proposition Statement:

who are dissatisfied with the current weed killers that evaporate and drift off, damaging neighboring crops and tired of the headaches and liability that come with the current spray, 
Our offering provides a new spray with no drift issues and limitations as the others, At competitive prices

Thus, Corteva has been able to gain market share from Monsanto by eliminating all the challenges faced by the farmers using Monsanto's product Dicamba. Corteva clearly has a competitive advantage with a better product using Differentiation.  ",7.5,"Three most critical areas of concern:

1. EV industry is definitely an industry of higher fixed costs where there is a lot of R&D, manufacturing plants and other PPE costs. Thus, the MES will be higher that is the company will have to manufacture and sell high volume of cars to cover up the fixed costs. Companies like Tesla have high economies of scale as it has set up the different charging stations, and since Dyson is not ready to partner with other companies, it will have to spend on developing charging stations as well. Thus, one of the major concern for Dyson will be the high start-up costs while not having economies of scale. 

2. Although Dyson has access to the high speed motors and batteries, it does not have any experience in designing the exteriors of the car. Thus, dyson might not have equal access to the inputs or the suppliers like the other EV players will have. Thus, Dyson will not have any resource based advantage (apart from battery) as it will face issues with access to the resources as well as getting the resources at a cheaper cost than the current players. Also, there are aggressive incumbent players in the market who will ensure that Dyson does not enjoy any competitive advantage.

3. Dyson as a brand is well known but that is for vacuum cleaners and hair dyers. But, in th EV market, customers are loyal to the brand they like. Tesla customers will most likely not shift to other EV brands and the older car manufacturers such as BMW have very strong brand loyalty. Dyson will have to spend a lot more on advertising to compete with the older brand enjoying economies of scale. ",5,"First of all, we know that Oracle is pricing its raw infrastructure at discount. This does not tell me that they have a cost leadership advantage as we don't have any information on the costs. They might have a similar cost structure as others but charging very low prices to focus on gaining market share. 

Now to actually identify the cost advantage, we will have to look at a typical sale and understand the activities Oracle performs as compared to other competitors to make the sale. - Here, the biggest concern could be that Oracle has to spend a lot more on Advertising to sell its product as compared to AWS or Microsoft, thereby ending up with a similar cost structure. 

I would need additional data on the channels used by each to sell their products and gain the revenue. This will help us understand the costs of selling the product. 

Next, I would like to see the economic surplus for Oracle as well as the other big competitors. This will help us understand the profits/ margins of Oracle as compared to others and also understand if there is cost advantage or is it just discounts. Thus, the Net margins will enable us to understand if it is sustainable.

Lastly, I would like to see the products or integrated products AWS or Microsoft can provide as compared to Oracle, thereby helping us understand if AWS or Microsoft have to spend more for a reason as compared to Oracle's single offering.  ",5,"The property developers of the Porche Design towers are definitely using the Differentiation strategy by not only using the brand value but also constructing a building like never before. Also, they have patented their elevator ""Dezervator"" and spend an estimated $48 million on it. Thus, they are trying to build a piece of real estate that is very different from the competitors with a sustainable advantage of patented designs, thereby increasing the willingness to pay for the customers. Hence, the property developers are creating value for the customers especially the porsche fanatics. 

Now, for claiming values, we can look at the construction costs, the number of units as well as the prices. 
The estimated costs per unit is $480/132 = $3.64 million. Since they are selling in a price range of $4-$32 million, they can easily claim the value that they are creating for the customers. 

Therefore, the property developer are not only creating value with the Porsche branded real estate using the different features particularly the Dezevators, but also claiming the value by charging a higher price as compared to the costs.

To further analyze the claiming portion, I would look at the competitive prices of other branded properties and ensure that they charge a higher price. ",11,TRUE,1,18,4,76.5

Tru by Hilton has smaller overall buildings and 80% larger lobbies that its competitors. This allows for the following:

Tru by Hilton aims to provide more amenities to its customers than its competitors at similar price points. This allows for the following:

* Urban environments mean high fixed land/lease costs and high taxes

* Consumers looking for rooms of this price point with these sorts of amenities may be business people/long-haul drivers or budget travellers/travellers visiting family who are frugal but seek reasonable amenities

* Vinyl floors means easy cleanup, which means lower per-hour labor costs and lower supply costs for cleaning

* No desks allows for floorplan space maximization

* No coffee-makers drives up in-hotel coffee shop sales

* 20% smaller floorplans allow for the hotel to get five rooms out of the space normally allotted for four

* Smaller buildings mean lower bulilding costs because less supplies and labor are needed

* The lower costs also apply for the larger lobby space, as most of that area is ""open air""

* Smaller buildings also mean less land is needed, lowering initial fixed costs

* Large, brightly colored lobbies allow for a more welcoming environment for the customer when they walk in

* Work space pods allow for customers to work in the hotel space even though there are no desks in their individual rooms

* Self-serve market areas allow for customers on the go to easily buy what they need without having to add extra time to their trip

* All of these examples are ways that Tru is planning to increase the customer experience, creating differentiation between themselves and the competition, which hopefully will increase market share in the sub-$100/night hotel room space",10,"Corteva's value proposition statement is direct and straightforward for soybean farmers. The statement boils down to ""Enlist E3 does not drift like Roundup products, so you don't have to worry about damage to other crops."" 

This message is extremely important to farmers because they either 1) have more than just soybean crop or 2) have neighboring farmers with more than just soybean crop. The damage to non-soybean crop is an obvious detriment to a farmer. If their own non-soybean crop is affected by drift, then they are essentially cannibalizing their own business; furthermore, if a neighboring farmer's non-soybean crop is affected by drift, the farmer spraying the Roundup could not only find their reputation in their community tarnished, but could also face legal action from the other farmer affected by the drift depending on their jurisdicstion.",3,"* Critical Area 1: Internal Capabilities

* How can Dyson differentiate itself from other offerings? Range? Pricing?

* Can Dyson develop appropriate methods of distribution for the EVs?

These figures alone do not indicate a cost advantage necessarily. It is highly possible that Oracle could be eating losses hand over fist in the cloud-computing area of its business to gain market share by undercutting its competitors. The only way to know for sure if there is a cost advantage is to look at comparable metrics (usually Cost based % of revenues from the particular product) across Oracle and its competitors.

* The answers to these questions lend great weight to whether the ""value"" of the building was created or merely claimed

* If the elevator raised price and the overall WTP of the customer base, then more economic surplus was generated and therefore more value was created. If, however, the elevator did not shift the overall WTP of the consumer and the elevator just gave the developers a reason to jack up prices compared to other buildings, then there was not an increase in the overall Economic Surplus and the developer is merely creating value.",6,TRUE,1,15,7,59

* Build hotels in non-destination locations (OKC)

This keeps land costs lower and allows Tru to keep price low because lower cost structure. Tru is also targeting the lower end of the market.

* Guest rooms are 20% smaller than comparably-priced hotel rooms

Tru can sell same number of rooms in less space (see below - Design 2).

* Outsource construction offsite

Construction costs are cheaper because they can be done in locations away from hotel. It's possible that Tru hotels have standardized builds that have parts that can all be completed in centralized locations. This supports Tru's cost leadership strategy.

 

* No desks and coffeemakers in rooms

Amenities are located in shared space (lobby). As part of cost leadership strategy, emphasis on collective amenities versus individual amenities. This lowers cost of purchasing each item for every room and cleaning the items.

* Choose locations away from city centers.

Land costs are lower in non-downtown regions. The article cites the firms preference for building near suburban highway exits. This again allows Tru keep prices low and deliver on its value proposition.

* Overall footprint of hotel is smaller than comparably-priced hotel chains.

Tru is keeping costs lower, and because guest rooms are smaller (see above), Tru can generate similar volume (rooms sold / night) to other comparably priced hotels in less space.

* Overall footprint of hotel is smaller than comparably-priced hotel chains.

See LEFT - construction costs for lower square footage (inferred that this is measure of overall footprint) are lower - this aligns with cost leadership.

* Creative lobby amenities (in comparison with similarly-priced hotels)

Tru offers self-serve market for craft beer and food and a rec area / individual pods for WFH. This creates an additional revenue source in an industry where margins are slim, and lowers costs by centering amenities in shared spaces.

* Lobby is bigger (+80% vs Hampton Inn)

See below - Design 4; Tru is using cost leadership by emphasizing ""shared space"" versus individual space. Lobbies contain many activities typically found in room (i.e. work pods in lobby versus desk in each room). Cost leadership because they provide amenities for entire hotel, which is less than needed for each and every room.

* Lobby is inviting (bright colors)

Inferred from text - This provides a warm/welcoming first impression to hotel guests when paired with other lobby amenities. It's possible this color scheme is purposed to give positive impression versus other cost-cutting strategies (like smaller rooms). It may give allure of premium hotel in mid-price hotel market.

1. Dyson has zero experience in EV space and its fusion of innovation and engineering occured in a different industry - Dyson expresses confidence pursuing EVs because it has successfully fused engineering and design in household appliances. Dyson believes this will translate to EVs because it believes it has the EV technologies - high speed motors and batteries. We don't know anything on Dyson's design innovation in the EV industry, and the fusion of engineering and design is central to their success in the household appliances space.

2. Strong Barriers to Entry - We need further information regarding barriers to entry in the industry. First, China accounts for 50% of EV market, and it stands to reason that there are large import restrictions given the politics of the country. Beyond China, the EV industry has high start-up costs ($2.6B investment for Dyson / $260M R&D investment), a steep learning curve, and I'd surmise there is strong brand loyalty similar to the rest of the car market.

3. Dyson Resources (or lack of) - From a resource perspective, we don't know if Dyson has the resources necessary to be successful in the space. They're investing in their PPE resources, but we don't know if it's enough. Their intangible resources leave room for question, particularly whether their employees have the skills and training to successfully enter the EV space. The Dyson brand is also associated with household appliances, not EVs, so questions may arise about how Dyson can unwrite that label. Organizationally speaking, we're left to wonder how Dyson can leverage potential synnergies between the household appliance and EV industries.",6,"To prove that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage, we'd need to prove that pricing lower indeed yields an advantage, meaning that Oracle has a larger wedge between willingness to pay and cost of goods sold relative to the rest of the market. For this, we would need additional data including:

1a. Oracle's price of cloud infrastructure.

1b. Oracle's COGS

1c. Oracle's Sales Volume

2a. Each competitors' prices of cloud infrastructure

2b. Each competitors' COGS

2c. Each competitors' Sales Volume

With this information, we can calculate profit margin. Profit = REVS - COSTS. Profit will equal the size of the gap between price and COGS. 

It's also important to consider sales volume when evaluating overall market competitive advantage. It's possible that Oracle's ""wedge"" is larger, but their sales volume is significantly smaller than its competitors. Perhaps this is part of their strategy if they are targeting a smaller addressable market within the industry, but it could point to larger issues and a lack of competitive advantage in the overall marketplace.

1. The developers leverage the strength of the Porsche brand to enter the growing brand-name luxury condo market. By partnering with Porsche, it's likely that they increase condo purchasers WTP.

2. The developers spend significant money on construction ($480 M) including $48 million on the car elevator. These fancy (and ridiculous) features should drive increases in customer's WTP.

3) The developers are intentional in design (open-air lobby, car elevator, no walk-up access) to promote culture of exclusivity. This should drive up WTP.

We need more information on revenue and cost structure of Porsche Tower and competitors to see if these development choices drove a bigger wedge between WTP and COGS than other luxury condos. A firm is claiming value IF and ONLY IF they raise prices as result of value created. We need to know if prices are indeed higher relative to other luxury condos as a result of the choices Porsche's developers made.

New entrants high barriers of entry:

* Will Dyson adopt a differentiation strategy or a cost based advantage strategy? - They seem to have better capabilities (innovative engineering and design) to adopt a differentiation strategy, but economies of scale and the learning curve of the automotive industry can be high barriers for them to entry the market.

* Where will Dyson launch their Electric vehicles? There seems to be space in the US market, but the high market share of Tesla (40%) could indicate customer loyalty, hence a more difficult market to capture. If Dyson decides to launch products in China or Europe (biggest markets) there is a more competitive landscape.

* Distribution channels: Would they negotiate with multiple brand distributors or would the build their own D2C channel? that would imply a higher investment for them, but they have to take in consideration that Tesla has several own distributors to make their brand more premium.

Buyers

* What benefit will the Dyson high-speed motors and batteries will offer in comparison to Tesla's motors and batteries? They need a differentiated product to gain customer preference.

* Would Dyson use a network effect with their household appliances? Is there any way to connect them to use this as a differentiator strategy?

Supplier:

* Does Dyson have the capability to build their own pieces for building electric cars, or would they have to rely on a concentrated group of car pieces supplier? - If they don't have the capacity, suppliers would have high power of negotiation, potentially increasing their prices. They are also highly dependent on the industry.

Enlist E3's value proposition of a dicamba/drift free herbicide has allowed Corteva to gain ground in a Monsanto dominated soybean market because it provides a solution to farmer's primary pain-points of having restrictions on when they can spray and the potential liability of drift affecting neighboring farmer's crops (both of which they currently experience using Monsanto's Roundup Ready Soybeans). Corteva has created a substantially different product from Monsanto which uniquely addresses the primary pain-point of the customer allowing them to capture market share. ,3.5,"1. Are Dyson's engineering and non-engineering resources extensible to entering the EV market? 

Dyson seems to have confidence that their organizational capability of engineering will allow them to enter the EV market, however, in order to compete in this market they will need more than merely engineering know-how, they will also need manufacturing, distribution, and marketing capability that are extensible to this new business area. 

2. Can Dyson overcome the entry barriers to be competitive in the EV market? 

While the market for EVs is large and growing and the concentration and # of players in the EV space is not unfavorable for Dyson (currently a fairly fragmented market where the top 5 players make up less than 50% of the total market), the entry barriers are significant in terms of capital for startup costs, and talent/capabilities needed. Additionally, Dyson is choosing not to collaborate with other car makers could put them at a volume disadvantage with suppliers. which unless they can capture significant market share will likely will put them at a disadvantage with suppliers if they don't have significant volume to negotiate. 

3. Will Dyson's brand name translate well to the EV market? 

While Dyson is well-known for it's vacuum cleaners, this positive brand image might not transfer well into the EV market. In other words, do you want to buy a car from a vacuum cleaner company? ",6,"Before I confirm that Oracle has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage I would want to know Oracle's cloud computing cost structure and profit margins as compared to their competitors (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, & Alibaba). Any firm can price cheaper than competitors, but only one that has a substantially better cost structure will still generate sufficient profit margins at a lower price. And further, if they are able to generate sufficient margins at a lower price is the way in which they are achieving this advantage difficult for competitors to imitate. If Oracle is able to create a significant profit margin at a lower price point in a way in which it would be difficult for their competitors to copy, I believe they would have a genuine cost leadership advantage. ",5,"The developers of Porsche Tower have created additional value through their choices of branding their development with the Porsche brand and the inclusion of the Dezervator in their design. By including the Dezervator (a significant cost estimated at 10% of the development cost or $48 million), the developers have increased the cost of development, but by less than the increase in WTP that the value of the Dezervator adds for the customer, thus creating value.

In addition, the developers have branded the development with the Porsche brand name (while the article doesn't mention the terms of the deal with Porsche to brand the tower) the additional cost to license the the Porsche brand increased the cost of the development, but by less than the increase in the WTP of the customer, once again creating additional value. ",5,TRUE,1,19,3,70.5

The price information remains to be seen. However, Monsanto can sell Enlist E3 at a premium price because there is unparalleled value to raise customer's willingness to pay.",6.5,"I think Dyson should be concerned about three items:

First, they might not have enough technological resources. They said they can apply their household appliances to electric cars and already make the necessary components to build vehicles. However, building cars needs more other components such as transmission and gear. In addition, other than components, building cars needs employees who have special technical knowledge. I think Dyson should be concerned with the engineering aspect of building an attractive EV.

 Second, they need to have a competitive, strong supply chain. An automobile company needs a lot of subcontractors and partners to procure the necessary parts for EVs. I think existing competitors already have a strong supply chain. They can procure parts quickly and impose bargaining power on suppliers. Therefore, whether Dyson can get a strong supply chain or not has effects on their production speeds and retail price.

Third, Dyson should be concerned about the worldwide lowered EV trend. According to 10 years of EV sales, overall sales have been declining year by year other than China. If Dyson plans to focus on the market in China, their business might succeed. However, they do not; they should reconsider their entry into the market because the decline of demand leads to decreases in customers' willingness to pay, which means they might face increasing profit in the long-term.",6,"I need the data below among Oracle, Amazon and Google related to AWS:

Tru hotels are located off of suburban highways

X - Assuming the advantage here is the reduce cost on PPE - the land development cost is less because the construction is in the suburbs vs intercity and this results in Tru being able to reduce its per room cost and have a cost leadership advantage amongst competitors 

Tru hotel lobby are 80% bigger than Hilton's Hampton Inn

X- Hilton is aware that competitive brands in this price range such as Day's Inn typically have enough lobby space for a coffee machine and a small front desk. Tru plans to differentiate from competitors by increasing lobby size to accommodate guest food and beverage and workspace needs 

Tru has seemingly 'easy to clean' guest rooms

X- Assuming this decision from Hilton would essentially cut down on cost of labor and perhaps lead to reducing the time needed to clean each rooms 

Tru has 20%  smaller guest rooms compared to other rooms in this price range

X-  This decision was made, I assume, to help pad an already small margin. Smaller rooms = more rooms. However, competing on price leaves for small margins or error. ",8,"Full Statment:

My top 3 concerns / questions regarding new market entry : 

* Does Dyson truly have capital structure to enter the EV market and still continue to innovate with its main money maker, the household appliances? 

*  With Tesla being the top selling EV in the US and China making up the majority unit sales with over 100+ EEV companies, How does Dyson plan to navigate the customer loyalty with existing firms? 

* Are there any government regulations facing EV  that are manufactured in the UK and might be sold globally? For example, if Dyson wanted to sell its EV in China, what are the government regulations on imported EVs? 

Some Additional Concerns / Questions...

* Truly, does Dyson have the critical human capital to accurately assess this business move?

* In the absence of what the cost of the new EV Dyson is looking to manufacture, I would like to know what is their introductory price for each model (assuming they would release multiple at launch)

* Dyson has great brand loyalty when it comes to home appliances. However, when it comes to EV I am concerned that Dyson can not compete on brand value or with supply chain capabilities (amongst other things. )

* It seems as the R&D, testing efforts are still underway for Dyson, I would like to know when would the empirical data on competitors resources compared to Dyson's EV be available ",5," 

* I would want to see market share shifts, margin growth rate and sales growth  YoY for Microsoft, Google Cloud, Amazon and Alibaba maybe going back > 5yrs

Our offering provides a spray that does not drift or harm neighboring crops at a price far less then a lawsuit. ,7.5,"The three most critical ares of concern that I would have are a follows.

*  Dyson's engineering capabilities in appliances, and ability to produce some components of a EV does not guarentee they will be able to produce a EV that differentiates themselves from competitors. Their pledge of $2.86 billion dollars for the project and lack of pre-established resources renders their resources at a strategic disadvantage to large competitors. 

*  The industry structure is heavily relient on raw material suppliers and producers of technological components (computer chips for example). The recent chip shortage alone is a major concern for the project, as industry powerhouses with pre-established relationships with chip manufactueres have had issues obtaining the chips and had to stop/slow down production at times. If Dyson can not get the required materials and components, they are dead in the water. 

* The competitive dynamics of the EV market are strong. Their are hundreds of EV companies with almost 300 avalibale models for purchase in china alone. With that many models avaliable for sale, it will be difficult for them to differentiate themselves in the market. Larger competitors (BYD, Tesla, etc.) have the resource advantages and brand value that will make stealing any significant market share extremely difficult and unlikely.  

 ",6,"Before I certify that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market, I would need to know the following. 

* More about the difference in quality between the services that Oracle and their competitors offer. Their could be a bigger difference in the services being provided to customers then their appears to be in the article. Factors such as IT security are not easily recognizable by most customers. Oracle could be providing a similar product at the service, but a highly degraded one behind the scenes. Additionally, I would want to know more about their customer support services compared to their competitors. 

* A comparision of price and service quality between Oracle and their competitors. Most consumers (I assume) know very little about cloud-computing and my not realize that while they are paying less with Oracle, the quality for what they are paying may be significantly less than they realize. ",0,"They are creating more value. That is assuming they are increasing their customer's willingness to pay more then the estimated 10% of construction costs associated with the dezervator. Customers attracted to buying these apartments value luxury and unique features that allow them to express their wealth.

Additional costs per unit range between 400,000-3,200,000 depending on the unit, but for Porche lovers with deep pockets, being able to drive their favorite car (that is more than a car to them) up to their home and view it on display can be priceless to them. That price will exceed the costs of adding the feature.

Here's why this value proposition statement works:

* Corteva chose their value via a customer needs analysis. They saw the need for a no-drift, effective soybeen herbicide that allows farmers to spray at-will. 

* Corteva provided the value with a product similar to competitor Monsanta but fixing the drift isse. 

* Corteva sales reps are communicating the value of no spraying limitations clearly to farmers.

 

*Note my assumption that Enlist E3 is at a similar price to Monsanto. There is no price data in the article excerpt, but I'm assuming that between two head-to-head competitors, one would not suddenly raise prices over the other for a comparable product.",7.5,"To express my areas of concern, I'll focus on the structural industry aspects of barriers to entry and competitive rivalry in the EV/automobile industry*, from Dyson's perspective, and whether or not their capabilities and resources can overcome that structure.

To a newcomer, especially one not in the automobile industry, barriers to entry are high. Although the industry is cleary attracting new entrants as sales grow exponentially, I'm not sure Dyson has what it takes to be a successful new entrant:

* The EV/automobile industry has a massive learning curve for a company wholly new to car manufacturing. Although they have engineers with experience building high-speed digital motors, they presumably have zero expertise in manufacturing nearly all other car parts, of which there are many. They claim the won't collaborate with other car makers, so unless they manage to recruit or poach some incredible auto-engineers, they are at high risk of lacking the organizational capacity and expertise necessary to succeed. Dyson does have their history of innovating engineering and success in unexpected markets going for them (the Dyson hairdryer is the best hairdryer I've ever used, by a landslide), but cars are a montrous product compared to their previous feats, and I'm doubtful this will make up for the lack in automobile manufacturing expertise and capability. 

* (**Assumption) Start up costs for an EV or any automobile plant are very high, and cost of capital for this endeavor considering its obvious riskiness is going to be sky-high. And to achieve the economies of scale of a giant in the industry like Tesla, they'll need to ramp up initial investment even more. Dyson appears to have the funds as evidence by their pledge of $2.6 billion to the project, but they risk failure, and I'm unsure they'll recoup their costs and deliver investors' desired returns, which can be detrimental to their reputation and stock price in the market. 

* Finally, Dyson simply doesn't have access to the supplier and distribution channels that incumbent EV/automobile makers have.

Second, fierce competitive rivalry renders this a dangerous market for Dyson to enter:

* Rivalry in the market is strong as evidenced by several top brands vying for marketshare, and a large number of smaller brands even making up a good portion of the market. Although there is no history (that I know of) of incumbent aggression, I fear this is a tough playing field for Dyson to enter and they risk being squashed if they cannot deliver an attractive value proposition.

* As rivalry ramps up and customers request lower prices, the pressure has already been causing EV makers to either drop costs (such as Tesla, with their cheaper/downgraded versions being introduced) or offer promotions or discounts (Hyundai is offering free installation on certain parts as purchasing incentive). So Dyson would be entering at a bad time, unelss they are somehow able to squeeze their costs low enough to pursue a cost-leadership strategy and grab marketshare from Tesla and the other leaders (which seems unlikely based on their lack on entry-related resources that I mentioned above). 

*I'm refering to EV/automobile industry as a whole here because I'm considering Dyson's perspective. Unlike a Ford who makes fuel-driven cars but has recently switched to making some EV models, thereby entering the EV industry, Dyson, as a vacuum and other appliances manufacturer, is entering the automobile industry as a whole, and the EV segment within that.",6,"Based on Oracle's recent jump in revenue in the last quarter, we might guess their cost-leadership strategy for the cloud infrastructure business is working to grab marketshare. To confirm, I'd want to see market data on the following metrics next to the comparable businesses units within Amazon, Microsoft, Google Cloud and Alibaba:

To confirm that Oracle's business activity system is aligned with a cost-leadership position:

* Net income and operating margins:

* I'd expect Oracle's margins to be lower than competitors; if they're pursuing a cost-leadership strategy, they're likely sacrificing economic surplus by pricing lower than the willingness-to-pay in comparison to the competitors, which would manifest as lower margins. 

* Key cost structure components of COGS and SGA (and components of SGA if possible):

* I'd expect Orables to be lowest of the competitors'. If they plan to keep prices low to succeed with a cost leadership strategy, they need to align their business activities by squeezing all components of cost, espcially COGS and SGA (for example, I wouldn't expect to see high ad spend or a large sales force for Oracle). 

* Average selling price (and whether they've risen since 2020):

* To align with a cost-leadership position long-term, prices need to stay low, not just start low as they clearly were in 2020.

To determine whether Oracle's supposed cost-leadership strategy is panning out (and the recent revenue bump isn't a fluke):

* Market data; sales growth grate and any recent marketshare shifts:

* Looking at last 3-4 years, I'd expect to see Oracle's sales CAGR increasing and their marketshare (most importantly unit share) expanding, pulling from the higher priced players like AWS and Google Cloud.

Finally, I'd want to track each metric moving forward. For marketshare, I'd want to see if Oracle's continues to grow. For pricing, I'd be interested to see if they keep costs low and maintain the cost-leadership position, or eventually drive up costs after achieving a sufficient customer base or even pivot to a differentiation strategy, investing their gains from the marketshare success to drive up WTP and create then claim some more value in the industry.",10,"Property developers have acheived a differentiation strategy here, both creating and claiming value in the luxury/branded real estate industry. 

Porsche Tower is adding value by driving up customer willingness-to-pay among their highly-wealthy target segment:

* They meet and exceed the needs of rich Porsche owners who desparately want to show off their wealth, resulting lavish lifestlye, and coolness via owning a Porsche. They practically made the building a Porsche museum and placed it in already-cool Miami. The phrase ""Porsche Design"" sign sits atop the entrance, and car displays are placed in front of residents' units and visible from the street, allowing a resident/Porsche owner to both show off to visitors and passerbys.

Developers spent money on this, surely increasing costs when compared to other luxury buildings, but they claim at least a portion of the economic surplus generated by higher WTP, successfully driving a ""wedge"" or ""moat"" between the two:

* They spent $480 million, which I'm going to assume is somewhat higher than comparable/other luxury buildings.

* They lease (assuming leasing here, but would need to confirm lease vs sell to make yearly projections) units between $4 and $32 million dollars. With 132 units, that's anywhere betwee $528 million and $4.224 billion yearly revenue, so between and $48 million and $3.744 billion in project profit. Assuming an even split between unit costs and number, picking the middle of that profit range, we hit $1.896 billion yearly profit. Not considering other variable costs, that's certainly a wedge.

more rooms with less space

* Site Selection 

* By placing Tru hotels in non-urban areas that are close to suburban highway exits, the company can lower land costs by avoiding higher priced property in cities while also appealing to a segment of the market that does not wish to stay in downtown areas. 

* Design 

* By reducing overall room space Tru is able to maximize the number of rooms it can offer to customers while also reducing costs associated with both cleaning and additional furniture placement (desks). Replacing carpet flooring also reduces costs associated with cleaning, while supplying a larger lobby area for customers allows Tru make efficient use of the space through additional communal amenities.

* Construction 

* As stated above, by reducing overall room size Tru is able to maximize the number of rooms offered to customers, which may result in higher income should they be able to fill those rooms. Additionally, Tru is able to save on construction costs by having segments of the building done off-site. 

* Guest Services 

* Including a self-service market area will likely reduce staffing costs associated with checking customers out, while the self-service market area along with both recreational and pod spaces in the lobby are additional selling points for the company. 

Overall, Tru's primary activities support their desired competitive positioning by offering a minimalist hotel experience away from urban areas while also saving on internal costs. Additionally, Tru believes that this activity system will contribute to a better overall experience for customers relative to other low-cost hotels. However, that remains to be seen based on the info provided in the article.",11,"For soybean farmers who are dissatisfied with regulatory restrictions placed on dicamba herbicide use, our offering provides a safe and effective way to combat weed growth without the issues associated with drift, at a similar price. ",7,"After conducting a five forces analysis of the EV industry, the three most critical areas of concern I would have for Dyson are centered around 1. the threat of new entrants; 2. the threat of substitute products; and 3. rivalry among existing competitors. 

* Threat of new entrants 

* The explosion of the EV market in the last decade has led to a significant increase in global demand for EVs, seeing an increase in sales from 55.4K in 2011 to 6.8M in 2021. This dramatic increase in sales and demand has also led to a sharp increase in the amount of competitors in the industry. As of Q3 2022 the top 5 EV brands in terms of sales share account for roughly 45% of global sales, which shows that the market is highly diverse and rife with competition from multiple parties. If demand in the global EV market continues to increase at such a rapid pace, the threat of even more new entrants will likely increase as well, providing Dyson with a plethora of competition and likely resulting in a very small percentage of market share unless the company can establish a sustainable form of competitive advantage.

* Threat of substitute products 

* In line with the concern above for threat of new entrants, the threat of substitute products in the EV market is significant due to the number of competitors. While Tesla, Nissan, and Chevy all dominate the U.S. market, globally, the threat of substitutes is high. Especially since China accounts for almost half of the global market, and 3 of the top 5 brands accounting for sales share are Chinese EV manufacturers. Customes wishing to purchase an EV have a copious amount of brands to choose from, and while brand loyal customers may say, for instance, that there is substantial difference between a Tesla EV and a Volkswagen EV, the substitutability across EV brands is relatively high.

* Rivalry among existing competitors 

* Rivalry among existing competitors in the industry is also a point that Dyson should consider. While the global market is relatively spread out, both Tesla and BYD still account for over a quarter of all global sales. While there is no evidence of a fierce rivalry there, it is worthy to note that all other brands likely compete substantially for their share of the market. Individual country segments of the market likely also breed fierce competition. For instance, in the U.S. Tesla is the clear market leader, with Nissan and Chevy fighting for increased share. While in China there are over a hundred EV manufacturers fighting to chip away at BYDs substantial market share. 

Overall, I would have substantial concern for Dyson entering the EV market for the above listed reasons. One positive they might have in terms of competition lies in the fact that they already manufacture a lot of the parts needed for EV assembly and could therefore supply themselves for those EV parts.",4,"* Pricing compared to other competitors

To create value, a company must create an economic surplus (profit+consumer surplus) around their product offering. There are two ways to accomplish this: 1. increase customer WTP; or 2. decrease costs. 

Porsche definitely has not decreased costs, but it can be argued that they have increased customer WTP for luxury branded real estate through the development of the design tower. The Dezervator seems to be one of the main selling points for the luxury condominiums, as it allows residents to feel special and unique in that the only way to access the building is through the Dezervator. Additionally, it allows residents, who are presumably Porsche enthusiasts, to store their Porsche behind a glass wall inside their condo to admire whenever they are at home. The Dezervator arguably increases WTP due to its ability to allow residents to make their Porsche a fixture inside their home. 

Porsche is also presumably claiming more value out of the chain by pricing at a premium. Total construction costs amounted to $480,000,000 and the 132 units in the building are priced between $4,000,000 and $32,000,000. Even if every unit were sold at the low price of $4,000,000, holding customer WTP and costs constant Porsche would see income of $528,000,000. 

Overall, Porsche is creating value by increasing WTP for branded real estate through an innovation like the Dezervator. Additionally, they are presumably claiming some of this value by having increased sales prices that result in higher revenues (this is an assumption, would need to know how other branded real estate is priced). The choices centered around the design tower create an overall economic surplus. ",5,TRUE,1,16,6,62

(Assuming the Enlist E3 has a similar price point as Monsanto's product.)",7,"1. Economics of Demand

*

* In the EV market, there are many competitors (5 large players, but other EV brands in total hold a higher market share). I would want to know how does Dyson want to compete with the other EV incumbents. Would they offer a lower price?

* Generally, EVs are not extremely differentiated and consumers have the option of purchasing gas cars, making it easier for customers to switch to lower cost vehicles (assuming customers have low brand loyalty). How would Dyson adopt a differentiation strategy where they can create and claim value from competitors?

2. Economics of Supply

*

* Dyson most likely has a stronger supplier network within its vacuum cleaners, hand dryers, and fans, but would they be able to build a suplier network within the EV space?

* Since the EV market is relatively new compared to the gas vehicle market, there may be a limited amount of suppliers. A limited amount of suppliers limits a companies ability to shop for prices and pit supplier against each other. There may also be high switching costs depending on where suppliers are located and where Dyson builds its EV plant. 

3. Internal Efficiency

*

* Dyson has been known for its vacuum cleaners, hand dryers, and fans and has built the organizational capabilities to suport that business. Can they do the same in the EV market? Will they be as organizationally effecient as the large players in China that have been in the EV business for longer and has a larger market?

* Dyson has limited expertise in the EV space. I would need to know how they expect to build their EV logistics and R&D expertise. Will they be able to hire expert EV engineers and designers? What will their value chain (manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing, after-sales service) look like given they're new players in the space?",6,"* We would need to prove that the strategy is actually gaining them market share. I would want to know how many customers are switching from AWS, Google Cloud, and Alibaba to Oracle. I would assume the switching costs are high between the 3 providers.

* Additionally, I would need to know more about the customer base and their WTP. We have one customer's data projections, but I would want to know the industry's WTP over the 5 year period.

* I would want to know what the different strategic policy choices each incumbent has made. Perhaps, AWS has a differentiation advantage based on their strategic decisions that Oracle's potential cost leadership advantage would not be able to beat.

* I would want to compare the gross margins of each incumbent. Has Oracle's revenue jumped by 66% in the last quarter, but their expenses have also increased? How do their expenses compare with AWS, Google Cloud, and Alibaba?",8,"* Similar to Ducati, Porsche seems to have adopted a differentiation strategy based on lifestyle and they seem to be creating value.

* We cannot yet assume whether Porsche is claiming value because we do not have access to their financial statements. We will need to evaluate their cost structure in order to definitively know whether they are claiming value. We would also need to know their current occupancy rate and their building's condo prices compared to competitors in the market.",12,TRUE,1,16,6,70

1. less-flashy locales like suburban highway exits

1. A large brightly-colored lobby (80% bigger than Hampton Inn) is offered as bargain to smaller rooms

1. Constructed in a way to get more rooms across a smaller amount of space

1. Lobbies have a self-serve market area, recreation facilities and workspace (- to make up for the lack of desk in the room)

2. Smaller room size allows the cleaning to be faster and easier

2. 20% smaller size guest rooms compared to typical room in similar price

* Corteva identified an unmet need among the farmers - need for a seed-and-spray combination that can combat weeds

* Corteva successfully addressed the issues with existing competitor's product (i.e. Monsanto's dicamba) - no issues related to drifting and damaging neighboring crops

* Corteva communicated its value proposition by leveraging the existing concerns of farmers - the concerns over liability that may come by using Monsanto's product. The display signs directly addressed the concern - “I have the freedom to spray.”

* Corteva's time for go-to-market also created a perfect opportunity for gaining market share - it launched Enlist when some states placed limits around when dicamba can be sprayed on crops.",3,"I would ask the following questions for Dyson's EV strategy:

* How can Dyson differentiate itself from its competitors?

a. There are over 300 models sold only in China. Tesla and other European manufacturers, such as BMW and Volkswagen have their own set of product lines. This is a highly crowded and competitive market

b. Additionally, the existing players have decades of experience in car-making (electric and hybrid)

c. These factors pose a huge challenge for Dyson the differentiate itself in terms of features

d. To give credit where it's due, Dyson has implemented new and innovative designs in the market of home appliances

e. I would also be apprehensive about how Dyson can separate it's strong home appliance brand image from a potential electric car brand.

 

2. Does Dyson have any specific cost-based-advantage that can establish it as a cost-leader?

a. It has no plans to collaborate with other car makers.

b. Although it has the expertise to build high-speed motors and batteries, the question is can it efficiently scale it to support the requirements of a full-size car.

c. Moreover, it is also necessary to evaluate if Dyson has any low-cost manufacturing advantage as compared to it's global peers (specifically Chinese peers)

 

3. Are there any resource-based advantage available with Dyson?

a. Given Dyson already has a high-speed motors and batteries, key components for an electric car, we may need further information on how well are the positioned against other car manufactures in terms of performance and reliability

b. Does Dyson has any key patents for any technology or components that may potentially be considered disruptive for the electric vehicle market?",6,"Additional information I need to know for assessing the cost-leadership advantage for Oracle are:

* How much premium is being charged by current players in the market? Such as Gross Margin %, Operating Margin % for cloud business. Higher the industry-wide margin, higher room for price discounts

* I also need to assess individual player's profitability and cost structure (COGS, R&D, SG&A and technology costs). Based on this, I can evaluate if any of the competitors may replicate the same advantages the Oracle has and may potentially undercut it's prices

* I need to assess, can these advantages be sustained over time. If the industry gets disrupted due to a new technology or a substitute product (such as Web3) then the projected market share gain will be difficult to achieve",5,"The average cost of one unit in the Porsche Tower = ($4 + $32)/2 = $18m

Total number of Units = 132

Total estimated Revenue = 132 * $18 = $2,376m

Total cost of building the tower = $480m

Total Economic Surplus created = $2,376 - $480 = $1,896m or ~$1.9bn or total value created.

Value created per unit = $1,896m /132 units = $14.4m

 

The builder made few key choices that have led to the value created:

* Fewer units in the tower = There are an average of 2 units per floor (132 units / 60 floors = 2.2 units per floor). This creates an incentive for high-end luxury home buyers to stay far from the crowd and noises around the big city.

* The buyers have also an incentive to pay additional premium to keep their luxury cars in front of their units, hence are willing to pay the extra dollar value

* Builders choice for design of the complex, which directly borrowed from the car's design elements adds to the perceived luxury appeal. This also helps to elevate the WTP

 

Based on these analyses, they are both creating and claiming value from the apartments. My initial analysis suggests that the value claimed is higher than consumer surplus created. I would need additional data around cost structure of the builder and WTP data for the consumers to find an accurate mix of value created vs claimed.",10,TRUE,1,15,7,63

Second, What is Dyson's strategy for differentiating its electric cars from those of established competitors?

The luxury and convenience of the Dezervator, associated with the premium of the Porsche brand, enhance the perceived value of the Condo units for potential high-end customers to have willingness to pay premium price.

- Value capture: The developers are capturing value through the high prices of the units.

Choice 4

Bigger lobbies with room to work, coffee machines, work desks/space, and alcohol moved to this areas. 

Tru seems to have figured out a great way to position itself in the lower cost hotel market. They have focused on their primary challenge, which is actually getting developers to build the hotels, by allowing them to build them at a lower cost than competitors. Keeping them in low costs areas is normal for this price range of hotels, but by decreasing room size they are able to fit more rooms in the hotel. Allowing certain off site construction will also decrease the initial investment in the hotels and allow for a faster breakeven time on the franchisee's investment. 

They were also able to decrease the turn time for each room by installing easily cleaned vinyl flooring vs the usual carpeting and having smaller rooms. The lobby holds a lot of things that would normally need to be cleaned in each room, such as the coffee machines and desks. 

Their brand value/power will allow them to charge slightly more for these rooms at around $100 vs $83, and they will have an easier time turning around guests after each stay. I feel that the strategy being implemented in this new chain will work out well for Hilton. ",8,For commercial farmers that are dissatisfied with losing healthy crops due to Dicamba drift; our offering provides a safe to use weedkiller that doesn't drift to neighboring crops.,4.5,"I feel that there are a lot of things to consider when looking at Dyson's plan to enter the EV market. The top three are:

1. Rivalry among existing competitors: It sounds like Dyson is understimating their competition. A lot of their largest competitors, including Tesla, have a large head start on car manufacturing. I'd like to know how they plan on building a maufacturing plant in 2 years with a car model ready for sale within 3 years total. 3 years from now, what will their first car model be like compared to what competitiors like Tesla will have released in 3 years with all of their current experience? They are also going to be competing with every other car company, both EVs and substitutes such as gasoline powered cars or other modes of transportation. 

2. How are they going to differentiate themselves among the hundreds of electric car companies in China, and the major large companies producing EVs in the US (That already have brand value as car companies)? I would be concerned they are overestimating their brand value if they think people will purchase a car based on it being a Dyson. I assume that they will be planning on a differentiation strategy rather than a cost leadership strategy based on the strategy they currently use for their existing consumer products. What are they going to do in order to compete with other car companies such as Tesla that have the same approach?

3. I am concerned that they are overconfident in getting a car made based on their current products. While they do have experience in making high speed motors and batteries, these are for smaller products such as vacuum cleaners, fans, and hand dryers. I would like to know how applicable this experience would be in making much larger parts for vehicles. They said that they will refuse to collaborate with other car companies, so I am curious as to how they plan on building a factory and develop a car in such a short period of time with no experience or outside help. ",7,"In order to know whether or not a firm has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage, we need to understand what resources and capabilities the firm has.

Source of Cost Advantage - We would need to know:

1. What activities is Oracle performing differently than their competitors.

In order to perform a competitive cost analysis we will need to do the following:

1. Choose a typical unit sale for their competition.

2. Identify the activities performed to produce sales.

3. Focus on the differences in Oracle's competition's strategic choices for the same service.

5. Compare each company's unit costs to identify if Oracle truly has a cost advantage. ",4,"The Porsche Design Tower (and branded luxury real estate as a whole) is creating and claiming value.

You are only able to claim value if you can raise prices, otherwise you are just creating value and giving it to customers. 

In the case of the luxury branded real estate market, they are able to raise values of the condominiums by co-branding the building with a luxury brand. I would like to know what the condos would sell for without the Porsche brand and Dezervator attached, but based on minumum price of condos for this building alone we can tell that value was created and captured by the developers. The entire building was developed for $480 million, even if all 132 units sold at the minimum $4M starting price the building would produce $528 million in revenue from condo sales.

The brightly-colored lobbies have a self-serve market area where guests can get drinks like Craft beer and food, and also boasts recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work. This relates to growing a niche with this differentiated strategy, hence increasing customer's willingness to pay

This is because there are no restrictions on Corteva's products as they offer a competing soybean-and-spray combination with no limitations. With Monsanto's, farmers are weary of the restrictions or limitations on the herbicide spray placed by states as time as well as the potential damage on other crops. Based off of this case, farmers have a tendency to move from Monsanto's product to Corteva's product causing Corteva to gain market share from Monsanto in the soybean seed and herbicide market.  Clearly from this case, Corteva offers a better performance of crops for farmers. With this value proposition statement, the willingness to pay for Corteva would potentially go upwards and then they can increase their prices. The switching costs are very low and as such enable the farmers to try a different brand- Corteva. Corteva could overtime increase their prices as long as no other players with similar products have entered the market to gain market share and extract the economic surplus from consumers.",3,"Three most critical areas of concerns are:

* One area of concern in assessing the likely success of Dyson's new EV market entry strategy would be the fact that Dyson is piting up against industry leaders over the years and has no significant experience in the EV production industry or of car-making know-how.Dyson is edging up against major players in the EV market who have not only invested in research and development but have been in this industry for a good amount of years. They have gone through several stages of an EV product lifecycle and have found the right strategies and implementations that make most of these brands stand out as market leaders. Most of these brands having large market share have garnered this over the years with a combination of trials, errors and losses. Dyson doesn't have the technical know-how on how EV operate as this is an industry that they are new to. I highly doubt Dyson's ability to compete effectively over the next two years when its EV would be launched. This is a new market for Dyson and the barriers to entering into this market is high.

* The second area of concern is the capital invested into this project by Dyson. Dyson faces a tough challenge breaking into an auto industry dominated by players with deep pockets, players such as Tesla, BYD, Volkswagen amongst others. There's no certainty that the amount allocated to R&D would be sufficient for the initial phase of the project. It is unclear if this amount is sufficient as there's no data to prove or assess the amount of research, operating and other related costs required to produce and sell EV in this highly competitive market

* It is also a weary concern that Dyson is unwilling to partner with any existing car manufacturer. From the case, it says that the company has said that it won’t collaborate with other car makers and only plans to rely on the fact that it made a mark around the globe by fusing innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances . This is a highly risky approach as there are a number of learnings and guidance that can be curled from collaborating with industry leaders in the market. It also would reduce costs if they consider partnering with other car makers as a huge number of fixed costs such as plant and machinery would already be borne by these other manufacturers",6,"The additional performance or market data I would need to know in order to certify that Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market are:

* A detailed review/report on the industry leaders and competitors for their financials and cost structures

We can see that Corteva is successful in developing the differentiation for its product which solves the pain-points of the farmers or growers have to deal with when using competitors' products. This differentiation is also strongly backed up by different studies and field work by university agricultural researchers. Corteva's sales are well-trained as well to clearly communicate this advantage to farmers or growers, contributing to the success of Corteva.",5.5,"With Dyson's confident announcement to enter the EV market with its ""credentials"", I identify three most critical areas of concerns below:

1. The fierce rivals among existing EV competitors

China, Europe and US accounts for 93% of market share. Among top 5's EV brands sales, three brands come from China, one is Tesla - from the US and the remaining is Wolkswagen. Tesla takes 40% of US EV sales. It is very tough for Dyson to compete to these EV companies. What competitive advantages does Dyson have to stay competive and win in this rival? Dyson's credentials are in fusing innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances and Dyson already makes components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries. However these factors are not strong enough to create the competitive advantages in terms of cost leadership or differentiation compared with established car makers or electrical car companies who have experiences in producing EV.

2. The high threat of substitute products and services

China has hundreds of electric car companies and more than 300 EV models available for purchase. Tesla has various successful EV models , etc. The substitute here is not the EV only among current EV options but also other options such as public transportations, cars using gasoline, etc. If Dyson aims at Europe, its public transportation is very convenient. Why consumers have to buy an EV from Dyson with multiple and hundreds of better choices? 

3. The bargaining Power of Suppliers

Because Dyson has advantages of household appliances but EV is different. Digital motor and batteries are just two among many essential components of the EV. Dyson's will not have the cost structure advantage to compete with current competitiors in EV production. It is an unfavorable for Dyson in terms of suppliers power.",6,"From the above prompts I have the information of Oracle pricing much lower than competitors in 2020 and for the next five-year projections. 

To justify that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market, I need to know additional performances or market data as below:

1. Cost structure of cloud business/infrastructure of Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, Google Cloud and Alibaba, breaking down into:

+ Cost of Good sold

+ Advertising/ sales

+ R&D/sales

+ SG&A/sales

2. CAGR of Cloud business/infrastructure (both market and individual companies) over the past five years (2018 - 2022) 

3. The financial performances of Cloud business/infrafstructure of these five companies

+ Net/profit margin

+ Asset turnover or return on equity

4. Net sales revenue of each company at least in 2022 because now I only have sales of Oracle in the last quater.

This is the differentiation strategy of offering products/ services at greater cost but greater perceived benefit for gaining competitive advantage, creating new value that results in increasing the customers' willingness to pay.

However, Porsche is claiming the value because:

1. It represents Porsche's strategy to capture the trend of surging branded real estates. Stefan Buescher, the chief executive of Porsche Lifestyle Group, in a statement, shared ""It was a natural continuation to transfer our unique design principles to the world of real estate,” 

2. Porsche' customers have the financial capabilities to afford and long for holistic luxury living or styles. There is no specific reasons or evidence from the case why Porsche should give these values to customers.

1) Market demand:

Which international market(s) will be the most profitable for Dyson's EV? From the data, China, the largest market, has been dominated by national brands including BYD, Wuling, and GAC. Meanwhile, Tesla has taken the lead in the US market. Although not directly stated, I also inferred that BMW became the top 4 EV brand in sales share through the Germany (and possibly Europe) market. Since EV has the tendency to win over the market within which the brand originated from, can Dyson leverage its British background?

2) Internal efficiency:

How will Dyson manage its internal operations and logistics? As of now, the company relies on its Singapore team to produce important components such as the high-speed motors and batteries. Location turns into a huge issue for consideration as Dyson would need to invest a hefty amount of money and time to establish factories and meet government regulations if it chooses Europe or US as the core market.

3) Marketing

While lacking in deep-pockets and car-making experiences, Dyson's competitive advantage is the innovative fusion between engineering and design. How will this advantage be translated in the electrical automotive scene? Dyson's positioning has been dedicated to the home appliance industry, which has different consumer drivers and frame of difference. The company needs to reposition their offer to become relevant in the new industry and then fit other activities in harmony based on the new strategy.",7,"From the reading, we currently have the percentage differences of Oracle's average price compared to competitors'. We also learn about the company's revenue and its percentage growth from last year, as well as the total revenue of the cloud infrastructure global market in 2022. 

To certify that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage, first we need to look into the cost structure of each player, which is not provided, and see their net profit from the current business. Also, it is necessary to compare relative average prices.

Next, we can also use the Du Pont Equation to learn how well Oracle controls cost, how efficiently it uses assets to generate sales revenue, and how well its utilize debt to finance operations. The lacking data includes average selling price (in currency unit), sales, total assets, and average shareholder equity.

Other metrics for further consideration are operating margins, key cost structure components, target audiences, market share shifts, and sales growth rate.

Tru opted to forgo big cities and instead focus on suburban highway exits, outskirts, and smaller cities. This keeps land and labor costs lower. 

Construction within major cities is more expensive than less populated areas so there are construction savings associated with this decision as well. 

The building is designed with 20% smaller rooms than is typical at this price range. This allows them to have more rooms per building, as well as allot more space to common areas. 

Tru design decision resulted in a lobby 80% larger than its Hamton Inn sister company. This area has individual work spaces, lounging areas, and recreational spaces. Additionally, there is a self serve (minimal labor to staff) small retail space for customers. These large common spaces have significant customer appeal. 

Design decisions were made that give the building a smaller footprint and enable some of the construction process to be done off-site. This lowers the initial cost of standing up a hotel. 

The rooms do not have carpet, desks, or coffee makers in the rooms. This streamlines cleaning and saves on labor and some material costs. 

There is a tradeoff here. Carpet is typically preferred. Some guests may want a desk and a coffee maker. However, these same services are offered in the common areas now. ",11,"For Farmer who are dissatisfied with Monsanto's soybean and spray product mix, our offering provides an effective soybean and spray combination without the drift and subsequent spray restrictions, at a (presumably) slightly higher price.
(I am assuming that Corteva is pricing just slightly higher than Monsanto because they believe customers will pay a little more for the freedom to spray their product provides. That said, it is very possible that Corteva could choose to price around the same as Monsanto in order to capture greater market share. Without more information regarding pricing, I cannot know. But I do not believe it would be significantly higher, farmers are generally very price-sensitive customers.)",7,"1. The first concern I have regarding Dyson entering the EV market is the learning curve associated with standing up and running an efficient manufacturing operation. While they are in the manufacturing space as well, not all operations are the same. The operational challenges of a vacuum plant are going to be different from those of an EV plant. While there may be some overlap, EV manufacturing has proven to be especially tricky, and all of the major competitors are either industry legacies or newcomers with a significant head start. They are going to be well-positioned to run much more efficiently.

2. The second concern I have regarding Dyson entering the EV market is how capital-intensive it is to Research and Develop car models and set up manufacturing lines for them. They have the intellectual capability to develop a product but may be lowballing the cost of this endeavor at 2.6 billion. It is likely that they will run over that amount and find themselves in a deep hole at the product launch. 

3. The third concern I have regarding Dyson entering the EV is brand adoption. Dyson has a great brand name for vacuums..... It is going to be significantly more difficult than they anticipate to change consumer perception of their brand to include EVs. Doing so will take significant time and resources dedicated to marketing and ad campaigns. This, combined with setting up manufacturing plants and R&D, leads me to believe that $2.6 billion is insufficient to fund this project.

Guest Services

Locations are closer to Suburban Highway exits. (Tru is closer to where guests will be traveling along to drive more traffic)

There are more rooms in a smaller amount of space with rooms being 20% smaller. (More rooms will lead to a higher number of customers and greater volume for revenue).

Some parts of the construction process are done off site. (By standardizing construction, Tru will both minimize costs and also ensure a consistent quality of final product).

The lobby has a self-service market area. (Tru is able to offer food and beverage service at higher margins because of less staff needed to maintain, and a quicker service offering for guests).

Tru properties have a smaller footprint. (Less square footage of land for property means lower costs.)

The lobby is 80% larger, colorful, with plenty of amenities. (With a lobby that's grander than a more expensive Hilton Hampton Inn, guests will enter the property with a more premium feeling).

The lobby has recreational areas. (This could be a feature of Tru properties that other hotels don't offer (""a signature feature"").)

Tru properties are away from big-city centers. (Value of land will be cheaper than in more expensive urban areas.)

Rooms are designed to be 20% smaller and have vinyl flooring (Rooms are designed to be smaller and able to be cleaned more easily, lowering cleaning costs.)

No coffee or workspace options within rooms, but they are available in the lobby. (Tru is able to cut down on cleaning costs by offering these publicly, not in individual rooms.)",12,"For... U.S. Corn & Soybean farmers

Rivalry among existing competitors: How will Dyson be able to compete against industry incumbents with a ton of money to spend and more years in the industry of making and selling cars? Dyson has committed $2.6 billion on this project, and is known for it's innovative engineering and design on household electrical appliances. It does have experience building digital motors, but can Dyson produce an entire electric vehicle system at a competitive cost to it's competitors? They will also need to do so in a reasonable time frame against other EV makers with established plants and sales networks (Dyson currently has an aggressive projection of to be 2 years to building a plant and 1 year to have EVs go on sale).

 

2. Buyer Power: How will Dyson be able to gain customer demand in such a fragmented market? Dyson is known globally for innovative engineering of electric appliances, but the market is full of competitors who offer more models (i.e. Chinese manufacturers) and have a more established brand name and image (Tesla). Will existing Dyson appliance customers be the same buyers of their new EVs, or will Dyson need to spend serious amounts on marketing to reach a desired target customer / reposition their EV to reach profitable customers?

 

3. Threat of New Entrants: Will Dyson be able to meet all required government regulations in order to sell it's new car within their desired vehicle markets? The U.K Market is only 327K of 6.8M EVs sold every year (4.8%), so Dyson will have to decide how much of which global markets they wish to pursue and any costs needed to have their EV be compliant with automotive regulation. Going into particular markets may also incur significant cost increases due to exports, marketing expenses, and any design changes needed to comply with local regulations.",5,"- To prove competitive advantage, one needs to analyze relative costs against industry competitors. One would need to prove that Oracle's internal costs are truly lower than their competitors by seeing the cost-structure of Oracle's and it's competitor's cloud infrastructure business.

-Are Oracle's competitor's planning to/have they reduced pricing on their cloud infrastructure offerings? A competitive advantage isn't easy to copy and won't erode quickly. If competitors can't easily reduce their prices to compete with Oracle, then Oracle has a cost-leadership advantage. This would be shown by price levels over time for Oracle and their competitors.

- What is the pricing strategy for non-market leaders who need cloud infrastructure? A competitive advantage needs to be sustainable to customer demand, does their low pricing strategy extend to low-medium size customers? This could be proven be seeing how their pricing for smaller customers compares against their competitor's offerings.",5,"The Porsche design tower is creating value by offering a differentiated feature (the Dezervator) which command an ultra-premium WTP from residents who desire luxury and gain value from using and showing off their luxury vehicles:

-The tower has an exclusive entryway where guests can either enter an airy lobby, or residents can drive directly onto an elevator that allows them to drive directly to their condos.

-Other guests and residents can clearly see these luxury cars as they travel from the lobby to condos in a glass elevator with a premium Porsche Design.

-Each apartment has a glass walled garage where the owner can clearly see their luxury vehicle within the confines of their home.

The developer spend $480 million on the property, with (10% * $480 million) $48 million spent on the Dezervator alone. The 132 units run between $4-$32 million for a range of revenue of $528 million - $4.224 billion. If it can be assumed that the investment in the Dezervator allows the developer to charge that range of prices for the units, then the Porsche Design tower is also claiming value by charging a higher price for a differentiated offered. The increase in WTP is greater than the increase in price, so value is created.

Supplier Power: high, market is dominated by concentrated group of suplliers, Differentiated resources/inputs, fwd integration as happened. 

Suppliers have a high power in the market for components. However, if Dyson can source all in house, it has a better chance. 

Other than battery and engine, what other car parts do they already make. 

New Entry Threat: Low because of initial capital needed. Not an economies of scale approach, 

Dyson will not be able to enter the market succesfully because of the barriers that exist. More capital will be needed and more money spent on R&D. 

Production life time line for plant build

Time line for car build to include testing

Buyer Power: Low, Limited number of buyers depending where they sell, undifferentiated product

Customers will be dettered by a household product company making cars. They will not win over the buyer, even with lower costs, unless they target outside of Europe.

We would need to understand their value chain. Then we could break each segement down to see where the profits are coming from and how they are capturing market share. 

By doing this we could establish where the resources are coming from and what capabilites Oracle has. Are they fully integrated or not. This will better let us see the competitive advantage they may have. We can assume the product is no difference so we will be looking at cost leadership. Are they able to keep cost per unit down while offering a competitive price. 

EX: If they are capturing 2% of 120.3 billion that is 2.4b. We would want to see the Gross profit and operating expenses so we can find the Operating Income.

Key Asssumptions:

* Where does Dyson plan to launch first?

* Current Situation:

* China occupies 50% of worldwide EV sales and houses >300 EV manufacturers

* As of Q3 2022, out of top 5 EV manufacturers in the world, 3 are China-based

* Concern:

* Considering the volume of EV sales and concentration of manufacturers, it is likely that Chinese manufacturers have achieved Economies of scale and can switch to cost-based leadership when required

* Hence, the choice of location can be critical for determining success of Dyson's EV launch

* Which customers is Dyson planning to target?

* Current Situation:

* Using industry's structural analysis, it can be inffered EV market's forces will be:

* Entry Barrier (strong): US based car manufacturers may rely heavy on economics of advertising i.e. gaining market share through ad-spend

* Buyer Power (strong): customers across geographies may exhibit preference towards certain manufacturers, hence switching cost may be high

* Concern:

* Each target segment will have its own value requirement and price sensitivity,

* Hence it is critical to strategically a choose a target segment that offers an unmet need

* What strategy will Dyson adopt? i.e. cost-based leadership or differentiation or both?

* Current Situation:

* Tesla and BYD dominate the EV car sales in US and China respectively

* Both have product offerings that offer value to customers along the spectrum of WTP i.e. varying model prices for each type of customer WTP

* Concern:

* In order to achieve market share growth, Dyson will have to adopt a volume-based approach i.e. focus on revenues over profits with low-priced products

* However in case of profitability, Dyson will have to focus on premium-pricing to gain sufficient margin

* Hence, the over-arching strategic paths are important to decide Y1-Y5 growth of Dyson in the EV market",6,"Category of data

Similarly, declining revenue growth will indicate short lived financial performance i.e. profit margin would eventually be <0 despite having lower cost components (unless they further reduce cost components)",9,"The property developers for Porsche Design Tower in Miami have created value through the uniqueness of the design across three key dimensions:

* Increasing customer's WTP:

* The Dezervator is the highlight of the apartment and allows home-owners to admire their luxury cars even at 60th floor

* Moreover, the rise in branded luxury apartments also facilitated the the rise in luxury car owners as a complement to expensive condos

* The combination of both abovementioned factors led to the rise in customers WTP for luxurious homes that have the ability to house expensive cars

* Capturing economic surplus:

* An increase in customer WTP will also giev rise to higher economic surplus if price of apartment is kept constant

* Since the designers spent 10% of $480 million i.e. $48 million on the Dezervator (an elevator) alone, their cost structure may be higher than other non-luxurious apartments

* Hence they have characterized the apartments as luxurious by charging significantly higher prices vs other non-branded condomoniums

* Providing Differentiation:

* Lastly, while there are other existing luxury apartments in Miami and other metros in US, Porsche Designers differentiated their offering by introducing the Dezervator, a one-in-a-kind elevator for cars

* They converted the Dezervator into an intangible resource-based advantage by securing patent for Dezervator

Part of the construction is done offsite, which helps get the costs down

Brightly colored huge attractive lobbies to entice customers and create a differentiated ambience as opposed to what customers are generally used to seeing with similar range hotels

Selection of areas away from big city-centers, to keep the land costs down

A much larger brightly colored lobby compared to what is typically seen in similar hotels, so as to make it a multi-purpose space which has a self-serve F&B area, recreation area and workspaces for guests. This will help differentiate Tru from other hotels in the space due to the additional services with easy access in the lobby area

Easily accessible market area in the lobby itself which has self-serve systems where customers can get craft beer and snacks without having to specifically go into a dining area/restaurant 

Vinyl flooring that can be mopped instead of carpets in rooms to make cleaning easier

 ",12,"The value proposition statement for Corteva can be created as follows- 

""For soybean farmers and growers,

who are dissatisfied with seeds necessitating the use of dicamba herbicide sprays that have state restrictions on spraying owing to problems with drift which can lead to liability claims due to damages to neighboring crops,

Corteva's Enlist-E3 provides a seed+herbicide combination with a weedkiller formulation that has no problems with drift based on studies by various renowned university agricultural researchers and offers soybean farmers and growers the freedom to spray as they deem fit, without any limitation,

at a price comparable to other similar products in the market.""

Using the above positioning, Corteva has been able to gain market share by exploiting the disadvantage Monsanto's product is riddled with. Monsanto lost nearly half of its market share - from the erstwhile 90% to only 45%-50% in 2019. We do not have information to opine if Corteva gained all of the market share Monsanto lost, but it would be reasonable to assume that being the leading player, Corteva managed to capture most if not all of the market share that Monsanto lost.",8,"The three most critical areas of concern are as follows:

Internal Capabilities: High-speed motors and batteries, though an important one, are merely one aspect of what goes into the manufacture and design of an electric car. The know-how, expertise and capabilities required (beyond funding) for the manufacture, design and assemble of other components do not seem to be familiar territory for Dyson. Moreover, the fact that they do not intend to collaborate with other car-makers seems like a risky strategy.

Timelines and Viability: Dyson intends to have the plant built in two years, and have the cars go into production and into the market for sale within 1 year from the completion of the construction of the plant. Based on the data, we can see that it took almost a decade for Chinese car-makers (who are leaders in the space with 50% sales in 2021) to reach substantial scale. We do not have data for the competitors on the time taken from development to market sales, but it is safe to assume that a period of 3 years is a tall and difficult claim for a company with no automobile manufacturing ties or experience.

Competitive Rivalry: Even mighty players like Tesla and Volkswagen have not been able to displace the Chinese players in terms of sales share (combined, the Chinese brands own 27.6% of the sales share as per Q3 2022 data). 3 years from now, the existing players will innovate, come out with newer models and try and capture greater share and attempt to build customer brand royalty. It will be very difficult for Dyson to break into the market without a strong differentiator in terms of innovative product design, low price or a strong brand (none of which it has demonstrated expertise in, especially in automobiles)",6,"In order to confidently certify that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market, we will need a variety of data points that can help us benchmark Oracle against industry averages and competitors in the cloud infrastructure space.

However, logically the revenue will be greater than $528 mm as the WTP of the buyers is estimated to be in the range of $4 mm - $32 mm (assuming the price range has been assessed in line with the consumer WTP estimates).

* The fact that there is a 8x differential in the price range for the units is indicative of the fact that Porsche is creating value for some of the consumers pushing their WTP higher than the others and at the same time is claiming that value as well by charging more to the customers with said higher WTP.

Corteva's Enlist E3 utilizes 2,4-D Choline instead to combat weeds without endangering your other crops, allowing farmers to improve their overall yield and profitability.

Note: There is no mention of price in the evidence, so I did not make an assertion about it.

This value proposition statement effectively capitalizes on a major design flaw of RoundUp Extend and the external shock of Government legislation that also dis-incentivizes farmers to choose Roundup Extend.  Corteva has capitalized on two systemic issues to move around 40-45% of market share to Corteva's Enlist family of products after two decades of operating as the secondary player in the Soybean market.",7,"1) Possible mis-guided Confidence in ability to compete on a resource based advantage.  Dyson is betting that they can take component parts of their firm and their overall systems to make them extensible into a completely new product to Dyson and a new offering in the overall market.  Dyson is willing to invest upwards of $2.6B in R&D to make this happen and overcome that initial barrier, but that development cost is extremely high and indicates industry factors that are not friendly to new entrants.  This could effect breakeven in the long run, and put heavy pressure to create margin via Operating Margin driven through cost leadership.   In terms of path dependency, overcoming brand inertia will be a challenge as people do not think of Dyson as an EV company, even though they might have the right tech and people to pull it off.  They would also need to develop new MES and distribution,

2) Existing Market Penetration and Competition - China, the largerst overall EV market is saturated with 300+ offerings which have a regional presence.  There are likely already economies of scale in place for existing competitors, and fierce retaliation towards new competitors as Tesla and other similar American firms have not been able to find their footing in China.  There already exists a differentiated competitor in smaller markets with Tesla and the brand novelty and corresponding higher WTP created by Elon Musk.

3) To enter this market, I speculate that they believe the 109% growth trend will continue, and that the industry as a whole has a high potential for large profitability.  Even though they might not expect to become an industry leader, they might believe operating as an average competitor in a highly profitable, growth industry could prove beneficial in the long run.",7,"1) Net Margin & Margin Growth Rate - We only have revenue data and have no sense of whether this strategy can be profitable in the long run.  Oracle could be shrinking the overall economic surplus through WTP decreases that outpace its ability to reign in costs.  In that case, a market share play would not be sustainable.  Would also want to benchmark these against indurtry and industry players in the short and long run to see if the industry as a whole is improving or whether Oracle is establishing an advantage.

2) Cost Structure Analysis - COGS, SG&A percentage, and corresponding growth rates.  We would need to benchmark these against short and long term fluctuations to industry averages and industry players positions.  These numbers could prove or disprove that cost leadership advantage.

They didn’t mention having either a differentiation or cost leadership strategy. What is their plan/strategy to have a C.A.? They also need to either have resources and/or capabilities that their competitors do not. They already have some resources and the capability to make some components necessary for a car, such as high-speed motors and batteries. For all other required resources, such as the manufacturing facilities and raw materials or components needed to build an electric, they will have to find suppliers. For the capability to build an EV, Dyson does not have the know-how and so the learning curve will be high, especially since they claim they will not be collaborating with other car makers.

Concern 2 – Suppliers will have a strong advantage over Dyson. Dyson will be disadvantaged against the suppliers who will have the bargaining power since there are very few suppliers available at all for many of the car components and very few substitutes. Dyson will not be able to negotiate by comparing prices and so prices will be high.

Concern 3 – In a saturated market with strong competitors in Tesla, Volkswagen, SAIC, etc, what about Dyson’s EV car will make it a viable substitute to the buyers? Does it offer a price-performance trade off where either the price is more attractive, or the performance is higher than other companies? Due to Dyson’s newness to the market, they will not likely have superior performance since they are not seeking out trade secrets from other companies. They also will struggle to have a lower, more attractive price since they have very low power over suppliers and so COGS will be high. If Dyson cannot position itself to be a viable substitute, why would buyers switch from the brands that are already successful?",6,"To know if Oracle has a genuine cost leadership C.A. in the market, you would need to know their financial and operating metrics benchmarked against industry averages and key competitors by looking at gross margin, operating margins, and key cost structure components (COGS, logistics, SGA).

Price

Keeping design to a minimum will keep keep costs down take less from the margin allowing for the lower price to go further. Customers will likely not notice unless quality is noticeable. 

Keeping to a smaller footprint will keep costs lower to build. This means a higher margin even at a lower price due to having less of an investment to recoup. Customers will likely not notice unless quality is noticeable. 

Having the level of guest services mentioned in the passage eats from the margin. Customers will notice if guest services are not hiring/paying people enough because they will likely be harder to reach and work with. 

Off Site Construction

Increases the risk of slight differences in design (colors being slightly different and resulting in clashing, things may not fit as easily, etc). Customers will appreciate quality design from a functional perspective, especially with small spaces. 

Allows for mass production which can reduce costs and increase revenue. Customers will likely not notice a difference unless things are not functional.

Does not affect. 

Room Size

Design is crucial with functionality. A small room, but efficient use of design and space can be quite plesant for a consumer. If the layout of the room does not allow them to put their things away or use all of the functions, you will lose them as repeat visitors. 

Classifying construction as layout, the layout of a small room can feel very differently depending on how it is done. A small room that is open tricks our brains into thinking the room is much bigger than it acutally is. 

A smaller room allows for custodial staff to clean much faster. (They mentioned in the passage they used vinyl which is simple and fast to mop). This reduces the amount of time customers are not occupying and spending on the rooms and increases satisfaction if they can check in earlier/later. 

Location

The smaller design leads to smaller footprint which leads to a cheaper price of land and therefore the ability to keep the prices low. 

The construction was mentioned to be smaller and sleek and location to be most likely off the side of highways. This is convenient for the target audience. 

Location itself has affect on customer satisfaction, but has little relation to guest services. The only challenge would be getting staff to commute to the location if it is too far into a rural area. Without guest services, you cannot have guests. 

Common Spaces

Design of the common spaces is mentioned to be a social place. While this requires more money on the front end, alcohol and food sales could make up for where revenue is lost on price of the rooms themselves. 

Similar to design, construction is an important piece here. 

Having guest services readily available is crucial to the common space needs of the guests. With good guest services (example, bartenders, musicians, servers, chefs, etc), people are more likely to spend more money increasing profits and revenue.

Tru has decided to develop its hotels in less-flashy locales like suburban highway exits to attract people that are travelling between cities that value hotel prices to be about $83 a night. 

The rooms are smaller allowing Tru to have more rooms and host more people than a typical hotel for any given night. 

The building is located outside the city-center keeping land costs low. 

Cleaning the rooms is easier and faster allowing Tru to reduce its 'room maintentance' costs. 

Opening 200 more locations in less-flashy locales of the US, would allow Tru to build its brand as a low-priced, amazing lobby hotel. 

The hotels are smaller than a typical hotel allowing it to keep 'building maintenance' (water, electricity, etc.) costs low

Removal of In-Room desk and Coffee Maker allows Tru to reduce its cleaning time. 

Lobby design choices like ""individual work-pods"", ""recreational areas"", ""bright colors"",  increases the WTP of its customers as their first-impressions of the hotel is positive. 

The self-serve market area where guests can get drinks like Craft beer and food, allows Tru to reduce costs in staffing / guest services. 

Larger lobby compared to other hotels (80% larger than Hampton), encourages people to spend more time in the lobby allowing Tru to generate revenue from drinks / food offered in the lobby.

Does Dyson have a cost-leadership strategy?

* The high-level cost components of selling a car are: a) Sourcing Raw Materials; b) Building the car in a manufacturing facility; c) Shipping it to dealers (in some cases globally); d) Delivering it to customers; e) R&D; f) Advertising. 

* If Dyson is able to siginifantly reduce its costs, then Dyson can compete with with a 'lower-pricing strategy' and try to gain market share. Hence, identifying the cost structure of its competitors, will allow Dyson to evaulate if they have a cost leadership.

Porsche Lifestyle Group is exactly that: a lifestyle brand. Customers that would buy condos in this building highly value lifestyle and luxury, and thus would have a higher increased perception in the value of being able to have their cars transported up through an elevator and the ability to display them at their homes for themselves or their guests to admire. 

The pricing for the condos result in a range of $528MM (if all units were sold at four million dollars) to $4.224BN (if all unites were sold at 32 million dollars) compared to the cost of $480MM ($48MM of which was on the Dezervator alone). Porsche would be able to recoup the costs of the investment once units begin selling, however there is no estimate on how long this recoupment will take.

Guest services

Choice 1

Tru has decided to create more rooms that are 20% smaller at their locations to maximize volume. If they have more rooms than their competitors it allows them to maximize capacity and overall profitability. 

Tru has decided to ensure that some portion of their construction can be done offsite which can potentially allow them to open their doors before all parts of the hotel are ready to ensure continued operations simultaneously. 

The article didn't denote much about the nature of guest services but my assumption based on the self serve market in the lobby and the no frills nature of the hotel is that guest services would be minimal to cut down on additional costs for the hotel chain. 

Choice 2

Tru created lobbies that are 80% larger than Hilton's typical Hampton Inn location. This creates a larger space for guests to commune, enjoy the self serve market, and individual pods to do work and offsets the size of the smaller rooms on location.

They've decided to build on a smaller plot of land therefore n they are paying lower upfront costs to buy the land and presumably lower taxes year over year. 

Choice 3

Tru has also designed the rooms to be easier to clean. They've decided to forgo the in room desks and coffee makers and included vinyl floors rather than carpet. This allows a quicker turnaround time between new guests. 

Tru has chosen to develop their locations in surban areas close to highway exits. Their hotels cater to customers that are presumably on a road trip and just require a quick stay at a low price which is a very specific and niche customer segment.

Choice 4",11,"Corteva's value proposition statement is as follows: For the farmer who doesn't want to deal with the headache and liability issues of ruining their neighbors' crops, Corteva's product, Enlist E3, provides an opportunity for all farmers in their community to successfully yield healthy soybeans at any time of the year and at a competitive price. 

* Additional Considerations: 

* Farmers who leverage Corteva's product, Enlist E3, don't have to worry about the state sanctioned time limitations on when the product can be sprayed. ""I have the freedom to spray""

* Instead of dicamba, their product is built around a herbicide known as 2,4-D choline which kills weeds but doesn't have the same problem with drift. 

* Monsanto's products, Xtend and Xtend Flex, have historically accounted for 45-50% of the soybean market however their challenge with dicamba opened up additional opportunities for competitors like Corteva to come in and steal marketshare.",7,"Three most critical concerns about Dyson's capabilities/resources to successfully enter the EV market: 

1. Competitive Advantage:  A business can only create a competitive advantage if it has driven a wedge between the willingness to pay it generates among buyers and the cost it incurs. Although, there are numerous competitors in the EV market, especially in China, Tesla leads this market from a sales perspective with about 1 million units sold in 2021. There is also a high amount of overall industry growth at 109% making it even more difficult for newcomers to come in and make a profit. Because Dyson is completely new to the industry, it will be extremely difficult to convince customers to pay a premium price when they're traditionally known for household applicances. They're also incurring a huge upfront cost which decreases their margin for economic surplus and therefore total value. 

2. Resource Based Advantage: To have a resource based advantage companies must have a physical, intangible, or organizational capability that sets them apart. This allows them to create a product or service that is hard to copy, depreciates slowly, and is not easily substituted. Dyson is attempting to enter an industry where the other players have deep pockets and a deep understanding of automobiles. They've created specific elements of their design that's not easily replicable in the market. Although Dyson brought their innovative engineering capabilities to the household appliance market and have teams in singapore that made 50 million high speed digital motors, its doubtful that they'll be able to create a resource based advantage in this market. 

3. Brand Loyalty: There's an intangible aspect of Dyson's inability to compete that is known as brand loyalty. Many consumers have a deep appreciation for and have a sense of loyalty to their car brands either because of the features the car provides or the lifestyle that the car represents. This leads to a low likelihood that they'll look for other substitutes and actually switch to a different car brand even if the attributes are similar. ",6,"In order to understand whether Oracle's strategy represents true cost leadership as a competitive advantage, I'd want to know: 

* Profit Margin: the measure their overall profitability. This is typically a good indicator of a company's pricing strategies and how well the company controls cost. 

* Cost Structure: how much Oracle is spending on advertising and sales, R&D, as well as SG&A in comparison to their overall profit. 

* Revenue: overall revenue to understand how Oracle is doing and be able to compare that revenue to their competitors in the marketplace. 

* Customer Feedback: I'd like to also see that rate at which customers are satisfied with the product that Oracle provides and if they are most drawn to the product based on the low price or if there are other elements that Oracle should consider marketing in the future. ",4,"The creators of the Porsche Design Tower are creating value for their customers. They are creating value by developing a point of differentiation in the marketplace with the construction of these exclusive luxury buildings with features like the deservator that increase customers' willingness to pay. As customers' willingness to pay increases, Porsche will be able to maximize profit which would lead to an economic surplus for this business opportunity. They would only be claiming value if they are raising their prices and the article doesn't indicate that they've made a decision to do so. ",10,TRUE,1,16,6,69

Tru typically is located in less flashy locales like suburban highway exits. This allows it to have lower fixed costs, especially real estate costs (land).

Guest rooms are designed to be 20% smaller. This allows for more rooms in the same amount of space as other hilton hotels and also results in lesser cleaning times for the hotel rooms that reduce operating costs. This also leads to lower land costs as more rooms can be accommodated in a smaller space. 

Guest rooms are designed to be 20% smaller. This allows for lower fixed costs when constructing the hotel.

Lobbies have a self serve area with craft beer, food, rec areas and work spaces. This provides a better guest services to customers that may differentiate them and potentially increase customers WTP.

Hotel rooms have vinyl floors instead of carpets and no in room desks and coffee makers. This cuts down cleaning times and thus results in lower operating costs. 

Allowing parts of the construction process to be done offsite leads to lower turnaround times in building hotels as well as lower costs, given the standardized approach for Tru hotels. 

Lobby is 80% larger than other Hilton hotels (hotels that are priced higher). This differentiates them from other hilton hotels and can potentially offset the smaller room design. This is to provide customers with a grandeur experience and potentially increase their WTP. 

 ",12,"Value Proposition statement: For soybean farmers who are dissatisfied with existing weed combatting seeds and herbicides for soyabeans, our offering provides highly effective weed control without any restrictions on spray limitations at a competitive price. 

Given the headaches soyabean farmers have faced in the weed combatting seed + herbicide market, Corteva's offering alleviates those fears by providing a soybean and spracy combination that does not have the same problem of evaporating off crops and drifting in the wind as drift (Monsanto's offering). These problems sometimes damage neighbors crops that lack resistance to it, thus creating a potential headache and liability of using drift. By creating a product that does not have the ill effects of the existing offerings in the market, Corteva is trying to appeal to these groups of customers who are dissatisfied with existing weed combatting seeds and herbicides for soyabeans in the market. They are directly targeting these customers by displaying signs that say ""I have freedom to spray"" to appeal to these customers and signaling to the customers that they don't need to worry about the headaches and liabilities with their product. Thus, Corteva has crafted a compelling position in the market to gain market share. ",6.5,"To assess the likely success of Dyson's new EV market entry strategy, the three critical areas of concern to be studied further are: 

1. Existing resources application in the EV market. This includes high speed motors and batteries. Creating a motor for Dyson's existing products as compared to electric cars might involve similar principles but they involve complex processes, such as automotive assembly, safety standards, and other considerations that are not faced at the same level in Dyson's existing product offerings. This signals an area of concern because we don't know if Dyson's existing resources are extensible to the EV market and if their existing motor manufacturing and battery manufacturing facilities can cater to the needs of the car market. Would this signal that they have to build a new plant or can they use the existing one? 

2. Can Dyson's translate its innovative engineering in their core product categories to the EV market? Even through Dyson's engineers may be extremely skilled in their current product categories, applying it to a completely new market that is extremely competitive can be a hard task. Similar to the prior argument, it would be worthwhile to understand if their human capital resources can signal a resource advantage in a new market. 

3. Can Dyson translate its premium market positioning for its existing products into the EV market and sustain operations? Given that Dyson does not have any manufacturing capabilities set up, no distribution channels and no design experience in the EV market space, will they effectively be able to create a differentiated product to sustain operations in the long term that can offset the costs of going into the EV market. This product must be in the higher price segment and its ability to use existing manufacturing, supplier and distribution networks can translate into potential success. ",6,"To understand if Oracle has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market, it would be helpful to know: 

1) The overall cost structure of a per unit offering across the companies. This would help us understand if this data is consistent across the companies and does Oracle really have lower costs with respect to the same. We only have information about how Oracle's products are priced in the passage but we don't have any information about the overall cost structure of oracle and other services. Further, it can be the case that Oracle has the same costs as other cloud service providers but offers cheaper services to gain a larger share of the market. If the cost structure of oracle is lower than other providers, it can be a signal to indicate that Oracle has a cost leadership strategy. 

2) Are the cloud computing services that are provided by Oracle similar to those of other competitors like Amazon and Google cloud? This would help ensure that Oracle is actually selling a very similar product to those of other cloud companies and that these services can be compared. If a service has very different offerings to its competitors, it would not lead to an effective comparison. If Oracle has similar services and a lower per unit cost structure, we can likely say that Oracle has a const leadership strategy. 

3) Financial cost structure and price data over time: It would also be helpful to know of the financial data over a period of time so that we can sufficiently draw conclusions about whether oracle has a cost leadership strategy. If Oracle has similar services and a lower per unit cost structure over a period of time, we can say that Oracle has a const leadership strategy. 

4) Do all cloud computing services have similar cost structures but provide different services? Similar to #2, this can indicate a differentiation among products that can lead to a difference in WTP among customers. ",5,"Here, the Porsche Design Tower is trying to both create more value and capture more value by providing a luxury experience to the customer by increasing their willingness to pay for a Porsche design tower unit. 

Value Creation: By providing a unique and immersive customer experience to the customers with the Porsche Design tower that is similar to the name brand cars, Porsche is trying to increase customers willingness to pay for a unit in the Porsche tower by differentiating itself into not just a luxury brand that provides cars, but a luxury car brand that provides a luxury lifestyle to customers. Further, the Dezervator is an example of a luxurious entertainment offering in customers daily life to increase their WTP.  This tower also incorporates Porsche's design elements into the real estate project and can signal a luxury lifestyle to the customer. This further adds to the luxury brand image of Porsche and can increase customers willingness to pay, both for a unit in the Porsche tower and for a Porsche. 

Value Capture: Given the premium price that Porsche is charging its customers for a unit, Porsche captures more value as well from the economic surplus of the customers. Prices ranging from $4 million to $32 million reflect the potential value of the luxury experience, including the Dezervator and the Porsche brand association. 

They create value by offering a unique and exclusive experience aligned with the Porsche brand, and they capture value by pricing their luxury condominium units at a premium. ",6,TRUE,1,19,3,75.5

Away from big cities - Opening far away from the city centers in the places such as Farmille, VA, and it would lead to the price sensitive customers who do not care about the urban setting to choose us

Smaller rooms - Guest rooms will be 20% smaller than the typical rooms, since the footprint is also smaller. Our customer group mainly cares about a place to spend the night, thus smaller rooms would not be a deciding factor in their choices.

Low cost construction-  The overall construction of the hotel supports low-cost structure by having smaller rooms and less need for the labor. 

Friendly and useful lobby area - The lobby area has drink places, however they are mainly self-service, cutting on the labor costs.

Convenient places for the target customer groups - The hotels are built near suburban highway exits to target the customers who are looking for a place to spend the night with cheaper rates

More convenient lobby- The lobby area is on average 80% bigger than the typical Hilton Lobby, making it a convenient place for the customers to have some drink and do work while waiting. It creates a unique position for our brand since most customers would not expect to have great recreation experience with lower prices.

More usage of rooms at a given time - The rooms are constructed in a way that the cleaning times will be reduced so that the hotel can serve to more people in a given amount of time, with that they would be increasing the market share .

Free spaces for customers to do work - In the lobby area there are individual pods, so that the people can work there. This would create a nice space for the customers to do work and also to rest if they do not want to spend  all their day in a small room.

Easy and fast cleaning - Room design support easy and fast cleaning, such as having a vinyl floor rather than  a carpet floor or the removal of the coffee machine.",10,"Value proposition statement: For the corn and soybean farmers who are dissatisfied with the limitations around when the other seed and chemical combinations can be sprayed, our Enlist E3 offers the same functionalities with the freedom to spray at a comparable price.

* Corteva has been able to gain market share from Monsanto by having a strong selling point on the weaknesses of Monsanto.

* One of the elements of the structural analysis is positioning the firm and in order to position the firm the company should build defences against competition by finding a position where the competitive forces are the weakest. S

* ince Monsanto has several limitations in usage, Corteva offers the same quality product without a usage limitation and if they price it the same level with Monsanto, then the customers will choose.

 ",6.5,"The main 3 questions/concerns that I would have in assessing the success of Dyson's entry to the EV market would be as following:

1) Already established market - High barriers to entry

* The EV market is currently very concentrated among the leaders of the market. They have an established market share and the brand name in the market that is very hard to capture for a newcomer.

* The EV market has very high fixed costs especially regarding the R&D costs, and the already established markets have a huge competitive advantage against Dyson in a sense that they have already spent bulk amount in the R&D and they have a know-how in the business.

* Especially, players in the Chinese market are hard to beat since they have a economies of scale and low cost structures due to the favorable production facilities in their country.

* Also, since there are high switching costs among the customers, it makes the market less alluring in terms of the ease of entry.

2) Product differentiation points 

* One of the main points that Dyson needs to think through is the differentiation of their products. EV market and the customers are not generally price sensitive, meaning their WTP for the products are usually high since they want to use the cars that would be less dangerous to the environment.

* Since the customer's demand are not generally price elastic, Dyson has to differentiate its product in order to gain the competitive advantage in the market.

* Dyson needs to find ways to differentiate the products that are hard to replicate and and market it in a way that is easily perceptible by the customers, so that it would directly increase their WTP.

3) Changing business model can lead to a reduction in the revenue of the existing products such as home appliances.

* Since Dyson is a major player in the market of home appliances, integrating into the EV market can hurt their brand perception among the loyal customers and they can lose market share in that market.

* Going into the EV market would require Dyson to invest a lot in that market, this could hinder their abilities to produce more quality products in their existing market and they can lose market share there

* They have to find a balance of the resource and capability allocation between the EV market and their existing and thriving market so that one will not be able to cannibalize the other.",9,"In order to better understand if Oracle has a cost leadership competitive advantage we have to look at 3 main segments for each companies in the market and the respective metrics and their changes over the years:

1) Financial Metrics

2) Product related Metrics

3) Cloud Market Metrics

From the Financial metrics, the data would be needed: 

* Gross margins,

* Operating margins,

* COGS, SG&A,

* Total cost per unit across the companies

From the Product related metrics, the data would be needed:

* Avg discounted price,

* Customer demographics across the companies

From the cloud Market metrics the data would be needed: 

* Sales growth

* Market share shifts

* Margin growth over the years and across the companies

If we see that there is a growth for Oracle in these metrics in comparison with other competitors, then we can say that they have a cost leadership in the market. ",9,"There are 3 parts of the value creation analysis.

1) Choosing the value - Here the main part of it for our case would be determining the addressable market. The Design Tower clearly addresses a very niche segment of the market which are the people that value luxury feeling. Our main customer group would be the men who are rich and want the luxurious feeling and the magic even in their daily lives.

2) Providing the value - Here from the primary value creation activities the main part that Porsche Design Tower does a great job is the Marketing/Sales and the Service that they provide to the niche group of customers. They get a unique service such that they can use Dezervator and have this luxurious experience.

3) Communicating the value - The firm communicates their value by having a very distinct product messaging, saying that ""It was a natural continuation to transfer our unique design principles to the world of real estate"" so that the customers will feel the unique feeling of being a niche group.

The firm definitely both creates and claims value by having unique features. Because of especially the Dezervator the customers will be willing to pay more for that experience, and since the WTP has been increased, the firm can claim more value by increasing the prices of the real estate compared to the other luxurious real estate projects that do not have unique features such as the elevators for cars. 

They definitely do not try to be a cost leaders in the market, rather they spend as much as they can for even small features, just to be able to increase the WTP of the customers. Their main strategy is the product differentiation which enables them to charge higher prices and have a competitive advantage in the market.",7,TRUE,1,18,4,78.5

Choice 1

1.) Designs that allow for parts of process to be done offsite.

* By allowing for parts to be done externally, Tru is saving time and keep costs down and could potentially invest that capital elsewhere. This is also more efficient as it will allow construction workers to complete tasks simultaneously rather than in an assembly line format. 

Choice 2

1.) Keep land costs down by having a smaller overall footprint (more rooms across smaller amount of space) and building the hotel away from big-city centers.

* By building more rooms across smaller space, Tru can save on costs while also giving the impression they may have more availability than other competitors. 

Choice 3

1.) By saving money in design and space, Tru can invest in a bigger lobby, complete with a self-serve market, recreation areas, and individual pods for work.

* By ""re-imagining"" their lobby, Tru creates a unique experience for customers who want to feel empowerd with choices (self-serve), have somewhere to be physically active (rec areas), and have a place to work (pods) - all in one place! It seems as if they're trying to create a ""modern office"" setting.

Choice 4

1.) Room design fosters faster and easier cleaning

* By removing in-room desks and coffee makers and using vinyl instead of carpet, Tru maximizes the amount of real estate available while also improving customer service and workflow efficiency. Faster and easier cleaning improves the customer experience and allows employees to take care of other tasks, or cater to specific needs of customer.

* Timeline: Dyson claimed that it would build a manufacturing facility in two years and release their new EV the year after. While they ""fuse innovative engineering and design"" on their current household products, it does not equate to building a complex system that an EV would entail. This raises red flags on how Dyson is constructing their value chain - potentially cutting corners.

* Testing: Dyson is based in the UK and will invest 200 pounds to UK R&D and testing. This causes concern because most of the value concentration for EVs are in China (3.5m units) and the falls to fourth place in terms of sales (327k units).

* Brand: Dyson is primarily known for their household applicances. From a marketing/branding standpoint, the EV customers may not take them seriously, especially with an accelerated timeline of two to three years and refusal to collaborate with other car makers. ",3,"In order to prove that Oracle's genuine cost leadership advantage, I would need:

2) ""Does Dyson have sufficient capital to successfully enter the EV market?"" - The EV industry has high capital requirements, with Dyson already commiting £1.8 billion to a manufacturing facility and £200 million to testing and research-and-development facilities.  However, competing in the EV industry long-term may require much more capital than this.  How much more will Dyson likely have to spend on manufacturing and R&D facilities? What does Dyson's balance sheet look like compared to their ""deep pocket"" rivals in the EV industry?

 

3) ""Will government protections prevent Dyson from competing successfully in the United States and China?"" - According to the information, China accounts for 50% of the global EV market.  The U.S. market only accounts for 8% vs Europe's 35%, however the U.S. population is just as large as Europe's and EV adoption is catching up (Europe having been more concerned with the enviroment earlier on).  The United States has recently passed the CHIPS act and an infrastructure bill that favor U.S. companies.  China's government plays a large role in its economy.  Will government protections in two very important EV markets (China and U.S.) prevent Dyson (a U.K. company) from competing successfully against BYD, Wuling, GAC, and Tesla?",6,"I would need to know how much lower (% difference) Oracle's price/unit is than Microsoft and Alibabe (we already know for AWS and Google its between 31-68% lower).  Then I would need to know how much lower (% difference) Oracle's total costs/unit are than its competitors. Therefore, I would need information on total costs and units sold for each company.  If the % difference in Oracle's total costs/unit vs competitors was larger than the % difference in its price/unit vs competitors, then it has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage, because it has successfully lowered costs to a GREATER degree than it has lowered price.  ",5,"The developers of the Porsche Tower have adopted a differentiation value creation strategy.

 ",5.5,"Among three types of Resources, Dyson seems to claim all three as its ""credentials"" that would enable Dyson to compete effectively at the EV market.

1) Tangible (natural resources, PPE) - £200 million on U.K.-based testing and research-and-development facilities

2) Intangible (brand, IP, patent) - experience of already making components necessary to build vehicles (high-speed motors and batteries)

3) Organization Capability (process, protocool) - Dyson's teams in Singapore already have manufacturing process that made 50 million high-speed digital motors, an essential element of electric cars

However, as Dyson will NOT collaborate with other car makers, in order for Dyson to not only ""wedge"" into the market but also to build a ""moat,"" we have to examine whether those resources meet the six required criteria. 

1. Hard to Copy - Dyson's innovative engineering and design are appreciated in the everyday applicance market, but other EV makers ,with deep pocket and years of experience under their belt, can mimic Dysons's EV.

2. Depreciates Slowly - EV subsidy can be political and often requires high CAPEX in the target market. Given Chinese EV maker dominating the market, will Dyson's engineering superiority be sustainable over a mid/long-term horizon.

3. Company Controls the Value - Each country is already setting the industry standard. U.S. standard is heavily voiced by Tesla, Europe is coming up with is own rule, and Chinese standard driven by its EV makers (backed by government's fiscal backdrop.) As Canalys's data indicates that top three markets(China, Europe, US) make up 93% of the market, even if Dyson can break into the market within its goal of two years, will Dyson be able to have a bargaining power to set its EV charging standards.

4. Not Easily substituted - Elements's research data shows how explosive the market has been. I would argue that substitute threat is unfavorable to Dyson. Also, by addressing a market that Dysons has not yet addressed before, cumulative marketing expenditure spent by incumbent firms can not be ignored.

5. Better than Competitor's similar resources - since I do not have any data on Dyson's EV performance or manufacturing capacity in comparison to those of the competitors, can not comment much about this.

6. Extensible to new business areas - On paper, this makes sense. As Dyson do have an experience in building electrical motors and batteries, there are transferable traits. However, EV also requires high software engineering skills and Dysons has NOT yet proven its ability to do so. Therefore, extensibility must be well demonstrated through its pilot vehicle.",6,"Based on the gien data, with Oracle's market share of 2% of total could revenue, even with 50% price compared to its competitors I can see that its quantity sold grew by threefold over the same period. However, in order to test whether Oracle truely does have cost leadership as a competitive advantage, I must see the Income Statement number for the Cloud business unit of the competitors; mainly Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

However, as competitors will show the top line contribution or cost conbrituion over all, it is difficult to argue that Orcale truely have cost leadership. Oracle just is trying to ""wedge"" into the market with low (bleeding) pricing.",4,"By spending $48 million to build the Dezervator and $480 million for the Porsche Design Tower,  property developers for the Porsche Design Tower in Miami have are they both creating and claiming the value.

In terms of the value creation and capture framework, the below holds.

WTP - Price = Consumer Surplus (CS)

Price - Cost = Firm Surplus (Profit, P)

Economic Surplus = CS + P

Therefore, by building the tower, Porshe increased the WTP of its consumer so that it can defend its high prices because it promote the status symbol and tells people that the company's financials are strong enough to afford such spending money on its branding. Yet, to claim that Porsche is capturing the value that it created, I need to see that Price increase in higher than the cost increase, which for the sake of the argument I assume so given how much Porsche raises the price every year.",7.5,TRUE,1,21,1,79

Get more rooms across a smaller amount of space - this will increase the sales volume so that with a lower price point, the revenue can still reach a good level.

 

Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range.

Adopt designs that allow for some part of the construction process to be done offsite.

 

Remove in-room furniture and appliances save cleaning costs.

Providing services to replace those in-room function create opportunities to generate revenues.

 

Tru hotels have a lobby that is more than 80% larger than its similar hotel lines.

Remove in-room desks and coffee makers.

Have a self-serve market, recreation, and work areas in the lobby.

Tru hotels choose locations that are mostly away from big-city centers - this will generate lower fixed costs. 

The overall footprint to the locations is smaller comparing to that in centered areas. This means that the lobby area might not be too crowded to affect consumer experience and satisfaction. The lobby can turn into a niche feature for people to socialize in a comfortable environment.

 

Land costs are lower than those in city centers. This can lower the overall construction costs.

Reduce unnecessary decorative and functional elements in guest rooms, only keeping the basic ones - this reduce costs in cleaning and maintenance and therefore variable costs.  

 

The room floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped, and in-room desks and coffee makers have been banished.

[Achieve Competitive Advantage]: Which activities does Dyson have in a integrated business activity system (logistics, operations, marketing & sales, and services) that can generate its unique competitive advantages?

As the top five competitors already took 44.5% of the market share, Dyson needs to have a distinct advantage to capture the share. Dyson has shown proven successes in development and sales of home appliances. It is important to know whether its expertise in the field can generate cost, development, or operation advantages in the EV field. For example, it is helpful to know whether the engine of a vacuum cleaner is similar to the engine of EV and in what ways. The concern is that home appliances and EV industries are very different.

 

2. [Value Creation]: What is the intersection of consumer and company values for Dyson? Will Dyson's EV satisfy unmet consumer needs?

As the main players on the market can already fulfill consumers' needs well, Dyson will need to provide something unique to differentiate so that consumers are willing to pay. Dyson has made breakthrough in industrial design in home appliance products. But for EV, how distinct the design advantage can be? Will consumers find it so appealing that they will purchase?

 

3. [Cost Structure and Comparison with Industry Level]: Does Dyson's investment in the project align with industry level (other competitors)? This will project its long-term health of profitability and whether it can sustain. As a newcomer and no cooperation with other car makers, Dyson will need to invest a lot due to the nature of the auto industry. It is important to know wether this will affect its cash flow and investment in its core business sectors - home appliances and how much it plan to continue investing in EV for the next five years.

First, they increased consumers' WTP by creating an exclusive and luxurious experience. Elements such as branded tower sign, no dedicated pedestrian access, and Dezervator car elevator gave consumers a unique experience and feeling exclusive that they are living in a community of the brand they love. As their WTP for Porsche cars are generally on a high level, to gain this exclusive, integrated experience to live with the brand, these consumers' WTP are even higher. This fulfills consumers' valued needs and therefore created value.

 

Second, in terms of pricing, the developer spent $480 million to build the Porsche Design Tower, where 132 units run between $4 and $32 million. The cost for this tower is significantly higher than average residential estates. To maintain profitability, the developer should increase the sales price significantly (comparing to average residential estates) and therefore claim value. 

 

If the increase of the WTP is significantly higher than the increase in selling price, the developers make a great level of profit margin comparing to other residential developers. And the value can be very sustainable as 1) the brand value cannot be copied; 2) the competitive position has potential to appreciate over time; 3) developers can keep step with change in consumer demand and preferences by discovering other lifestyle brands in the future.",7,TRUE,1,21,1,81.5

Focusing on suburban highway exit locations and ""less flashy"" locales raises the likelihood that Tru's approach will be differentiated in that market.

To help maintain lower cost-structure, the materials in the rooms (e.g., vinyl flooring) and furnishing (e.g., lack of coffee maker and desk) help reduce time/cost of room cleaning (COGS).

To improve cost efficiency, the hotels are able to be partially constructed off-site, reducing labor costs and improving speed-to-market.

Features self-service market which encourages sales of craft beverages and food. Self-service reduces labor expense and craft goods can justify boutique (higher) prices. Also, less inventory expense is tied up in perishable goods that sit in hotel rooms and instead are centrally located.

By differentiating their offering, Tru can capture the higher WTP of ~$100/night whereas traditional mid-tier hoteliers average closer to $83/night in similar markets.

To improve attractiveness to developers, the hotels sit on a smaller footprint yet have more rooms. As a result, any increase in material expense or added risk of building a new type of hotel is diminished by the expectation of greater nightly capacity and higher prices (P*V).

Costs are reduced by having an area of dedicated working pods available vs. providing desks to every room.

The targeted sites also help with cost as the land prices will be significantly lower than those located near larger cities.",10,"Designed for soybean farmers, Corteva's soybean-and-spray solution, Enlist E3, offers the same weedkiller protection as Monsanto, but without the need to worry about the damage caused by dicamba drift.

* How can Dyson compete in the EV market?

* It is difficult to see Dyson entering with success a market that is highly technical, capex intensive, and occupied with successful incumbents. 

* Questions I have:

* Assuming Dyson pursues an innovation and differentiation strategy (given ""credentials"" and current positioning),  I would want to understand how Dyson believes it will differentiate itself?

* What segments within the market does Dyson intend to target?

* What scale does Dyson intend to pursue (e.g., a niche UK-focused operation vs. a global competitor)? 

* What is the competitive environment look like for UK?

* Does Dyson have the resources to deliver an EV?

* While Dyson has engineering resources and a positive brand image, I do not believe these will extend to the EV space. Also, the investment amounts specified appear low in comparison to what existing manufacturers spend in development for current autos.

* Additional questions: 

* How does know-how of appliance manufacturing translate to EV?

* Does Dyson have the financial resources to deliver an EV?

* Does Dyson have the human capital / R&D resources to deliver an EV?

* Does Dyson's brand a resource or constraint in pursuing an EV?

* Can Dyson establish the capabilities to deliver an EV?

I would assess that it would be difficult fore Dyson to achieve success in the EV market. The upfront cost associated with the EV venture would not be too difficult for Dyson since it is already a global brand powerhouse. However, with the relatively short timeline it has set for itself of 3 years to have a vehicle on sale seems short. Dyson's brand name would be more of an issue when you think of EV's since its most commonly known for its high tech home appliances. Next, the competitive market in the EV world is high. The barriers to entry would be difficult but not out of reach for the global appliance giant. My concern here would be the ability of the large car manufacturers would easily out price and out market any attempt at Dyson's EV product.

* * The article does not provide any price information, but it can be inferred that the price must have been NOT INCREASE due to dramatic change in market share. If applied, price increase could have deteriorated the WTP and may not achieved such result. Thus, the price should have been lower or at par with Monsanto's product.",8,"Will resource-based competitive advantage of Dyson also work in EV industry?

* Although Dyson says that it has engineering and design capability (from leading the high-end consumer electrics market), the repeatability of this resource must be validated.

* The specification (considering product life cycle, safety) and size is very different from consumder electric to vehicle.

Is EV inudstry sufficiently attractive for Dyson?

* The market, with electrification megatrend, itself seems to be attractive since it shows tremendous growth potential, 109% ('20, '21 yoy). But, on high level, we need to validate if it is attractive for Dyson because (stated above) EV market is very different from high-end consumer electrics.

* Industry structure must be studied (i.e., through Michael Porter's Five Forces) to identify main industry level determinants of profitability.

* Through study, Dyson may find that capital injection (for manufacturing) required to initiate this business may be too large  and regional portfolio is disfavorable for them. For example, China constitutes more than half of the market but local car OEMs (i.e., BYD, SAIC) seem to have tremendous advantage by government regulation. With smaller pie, it is questionable that Dyson can achieve sufficient ""size of prize"" in this industry.

What will be Dyson's competitive advantage among strong competitors?

* vs. Incumbent : Dyson is likely to choose differentiation strategy rather than cost leadership strategy, because as a late entrant it is very difficult to gain MES (minium efficient scale) in short period. There is a large risk that Dyson stay as small player and retire ultimately because it never achieve comptitive cost structure.

* vs. New Entrant : Rather, differentiation strategy may be adopted by Dyson using its ""uniqueness"" in design. However, this is also at large risk because when company (but better) enters with same strategy. Apple car would be a good example. They both share high design capability with ambitions of entering EV segment, but Apple is just better, more renowned, and, of course, a lot richer.  

Why now?

* Dyson also must answer why is this a good time to enter this market. Considering its strategic positioning (that Dyson targets), the entry timing may be too late or too early.",9,"Is this industry structurally attracitive?

* Market Growth: Oracle's revenue is rising, but is total market growing also? How will the growth rate be in next 10~20 years? Does it provide enough growth potential for Oracle to achieve MES?

* Cost Strcuture of Industry: Fixed cost (what type), Variable Cost. What is more efficient way to reduce cost? (lay-off engineer, maximize revenue and etc)

* Competition: Will there be more new entrants with same business background? (like SAP)

What is Total Addressable Market for Oracle in cloud Computing Industry?

* We need more market data by segments to validate this. Oracle may fail to achieve MES to settle down its cost structure.

* Oracle's solution may be very (too) specific to segment limiting its growth potential.

* For example, it may be applicable (or most favorable) for Enterprise in maufacturing business. On the other hands, Amazon and Google clouds may have flexibility that individual consumers can also approach (making the total address market a lot larger!)

What is apple-to-apple comparison in function with competitiors (similarity of product offering)?

* We need to understand what are product/service included in this solution. Basic function is probably similar (Oracle is also top company of ERP system), but in detail the capability of solution may be very different. Oracle's solution may not be cheap after all, considering the Total Cost of Ownership for customers.

* Customization : How easily the SW can be adopted to company's required objective (extent and easiness of customization) is also key features to compare. You may need System Integrator to use this solution in specific company. Will Oracle do it for you, or will you need to pay other firm to do it? 

* After service : Aftersales market can be very important in SW sector. If it incur more capital must be validated.

* Server Stability : Does Oracle has cloud service center with all the stability features to prevent shut-down in server? (such as, having UPS system installed in cloud centre) Oracle may not have these into cost consideration.

* Additional Features : Extra function must be compared. Being more expansive, other solution provider may offer additional features like guarantee of ultra speed, and free of charge application for individual employee (and controllability) at free of charge.",7,"Value Creation

* Porche Design tower was to increase economic surplus by maximizing WTP with state-of-art design (repeated from Porsche's design capability) and Dezervator (with unique appearance, and patent), although there is significant cost increase.

* It can be implied that differentiation strategy in design and uniqueness has enhanced consumer surplus even more by increasing the potential WTP.

* This is valuable because it is hard to copy (Porsche brand, patent of elevator and etc), not easily substituted and better than competitors (very few brand would still be flashy compared to Porsche. and those demand may be too small)

* This increased WTP must be more than cost increase for luxurious contents and appliances of this building.

Value Claiming

* Although value is created, how it will be claim wil rely on price choice. All value created may be capture or some may be shared with customers. However, company competing on differentiation can claim value only if they raise price.

 ",11,"In this article,  Corteva sales representatives told growers that Enlist doesn’t have the same spraying limitations as its competitor’s product. 

In this market, there are high barriers of entry, no substitutes as far. moreover, I assume that as first raw material suppliers, securing the power of suppliers and buyers rely on Monsanto and Corteva  (70$ M/S)

Therefore, they will enhance their strategy to overcome their rival company, Monsanto to support Differentiation to the customer.

Enlist E3, weedkiller doesn’t have the same problem with drift, according to various studies and fieldwork by university agricultural researchers. therefore, restrictions on Monsanto’s spray have become a selling point for Corteva to expand their market share.

As a reference, In this article, the cost structure and price of how they can earn the profit margin, but I can infer that they will earn enough margin.

 

 ",3,"Firstly, I checked their resources,   Dyson had various experiences with high-speed motors and batteries, making components necessary to build vehicles and they have enough human resources in Singapore. Therefore The company plans to cooperate in developing electric vehicles with their existing asset.

After that, I will review the market environment (structure attractiveness of EV market.) In this market, there are already lots of players securing their own EV knowledge. Although Dyson has similar technology adopting EV, it expects that Dyson would try to catch the existing players. Moreover, the entry barrier is one of the important factors for Dyson. if huge entry fee(plant construction, patent) and totally different technology, they consider how can enter the business with positive revenue and margin (how long they can cover the entry fee.)

Assuming that the above factors are closed, they also figure out the source of competitive advantage; what value creation and capture, is it available to have a sustainable position and hard to imitate to other competitors? In addition, they will review customer's willingness to pay and their cost structure too.",8,"Firstly, cost leadership is found that cost down is more merit than WTP down. therefore firstly I figure out the customer's willingness to pay.

Moreover, entry barriers are also important factors. they recognized plant construction, marketing, R&D, and distribution costs. The price is significantly cheaper than others but if they spend lots of COGS, SG&A, and so on, it doesn't have cost leadership, just for securing M/S, they reduce their price under the cost.

First, they adopt value creation supporting the differentiation to customers. It is a luxury brand so, these customers love to receive special service from others paying more money. therefore even though The developer spent a lot of money and we don't know the customer satisfaction status, I expect that the experience in the tower will cause an increase in WTP.  

And it also adopts the value capture. To show the luxury building and space with porches, many customers are attracted to this brand. It means they could revise the supply chain (from ""inbound logistics -> operaiton -> outbound logistics -> marketing sales -> service -> value"" to ""marketing sales -> inbound logistics -> operation -> outbound logistics ->  service -> value"")

*

Capability in Cars:

Issue: Dyson is skilled in making motors and batteries but cars need more, like safety and transmission systems. Building a car is different than making electronics .

Question: Can Dyson move from making home tools to cars easily? How will they handle car safety rules?

 

 

Assessment: Just as numerous new electric vehicle companies have emerged in China, I believe there's still ample room in the electric car market for new entrants. I expect Dyson to break out of its traditional home tool company and find success.

*

Competition in EV Market:

Issue: There are big players in the electric vehicle (EV) market like Tesla. Old car makers with a lot of money are also joining in.

Question: With tough rivals, how will Dyson make their cars stand out? Is it good or bad that they're not teaming up with other car makers?

 

 

 

Assessment: At first, they might face challenges, but as Tesla did in the early electric vehicle market, they are expected to succeed without collaborating with existing automakers

*

Brand Image:

Issue: People know Dyson for quality home tools, not cars.

Question: How will Dyson make people trust them for cars? Can their cool home tools convince people to buy their cars?

Assessment: While it may not be easy, considering Dyson's demonstrated innovative brand image over the years, is is believed they will release a considerably innovative product in the electric vehicle market.",6,"*

Cost Perspective:

Does Oracle operate at a lower cost than competitors, or are they merely lowering prices to attract customers? It's essential to compare their costs with other companies.

*

Quality/Performance/Customer Satisfaction Perspective:

Does Oracle's inexpensive service maintain a decent quality? A comparison with the quality of services like AWS and Google Cloud is necessary.

*

Service Range:

Does Oracle offer as many cloud services as other companies? It's crucial to check if they provide too limited services just to cut down on prices.

*

Financial Aspects:

Does Oracle have the financial stability to maintain low prices continually? It needs to be verified if they're taking high financial risks just to penetrate the market.

*

Growth Compared to Competitors:

Oracle's cloud business has grown by 66%, but are competitors growing faster?

*

Market Share and Revenue/Operating Profit Data:

By understanding the revenue data and market share, one can evaluate if Oracle's pricing strategy and other tactics are appropriate.",9,"Value creation

* Unique Features: The Porsche Design Tower is special because it has a special car elevator called ""Dezervator"", sky-high garages for cars, and looks stylish like a Porsche car.

Less-flashy locales like suburban highway exits. Hilton's Tru chose to follow this strategic location to capture the lower-end of the customer segment that can only affords the cost of around $83/night for a room. By staying away from fancy/touristy/downtown locations help filter and attract that group of customers.

Get more rooms across a smaller amount of space --> Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range --> Overall footprint of the property is smaller. This strategic choice allows Tru to maximize their number of rooms, hence maximizing their revenue in a confined area of estate (links back to managing land cost.)

Some part of the construction process can be done offsite. This allows Hilton's Tru to cut down the construction cost, probably by outsourcing parts of the construction to different contractors who have more competitive costs, and also expedite the construction timing by constructing multiple parts at the same time.

Brightly-colored lobbies have a self-serve market area, and also boasts recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work. By removing the room desk & coffee machine in the room, this choice creates value-added benefits (or compensates) for customers who has the needs to work during their stay or have a refreshment/food requirement.

Be away from big-city centers. This choice help Hilton's Tru manage to keep their land costs down. Usually it's the cost of 50-year leasing cost for the land they serviced.

Rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. Rather than carpet, floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped, and in-room desks and coffee makers have been banished, also to cut down on cleaning times. This choice helps them trim down the cleaning (operation) cost and also cost of furnitures, as it deemed that consumers in this low-tier segment are agnostic of whether they have this furnitures or not in trading for lower price.

Lobby that is more than 80% larger than Hilton’s typical Hampton Inn location, which is priced slightly higher than Tru. This bigger lobby helps to attract customers as it attest the quality & standard despite the low-price offerings from Tru, seen as a great incentive when entering the hotel.",12,"* For soybean-growing farmers, who are dissatisfied with Mosanto's soybean seed and herbicide products that have Dicamba in their composition, particularly Xtend & XtendFlex, Corteva's Enlist E3 provide the same weedkiller benefit that does not have the side-effect of evaporating, drifting in the wind and damaging neighbor's crop.

* Corteva has chosen to differentiate its soybean-and-spray offer to Mosanto's by addressing the downside of their competitor's products, which is the drifting and damaging neighbor's crops that have a weak resistance to the weed-killing chemical Dicamba. They launched an improved product and proudly communicated that to the farmers through trade shows, and probably other means of communications via the slogan ""I have the freedom to spray"".

* It is inconclusive that Corteva's Enlist 3 has a better pricing position versus Xtend & XtendFlex as the paragraph does not disclose. ",7,"* The biggest concern for Dyson to enter EV market is the technical know-how in electrical car-making process. All the major players in the segment (Tesla, Volkswagen, SAIC, BYD, BMW or Hyundai) have established business in automotive and have decades of industry knowledge to penetrate successfully from traditional fossil-fueled car to electrical car. Not to mention the robust technologies/innovations they have of automotive-related parts like engines, brakes, aerodynamics, safety procedure,...Dyson would have to invest tremendously with the hope to catch up this learning curve, given the fact that they won't collaborate with any car makers.

* Second is the strategy that Dyson would choose to pursue for this product. They have been famously known for differentiation in their core business, household appliances, and charge premium price for it. But without technical know-how, it's hardly convinced that they can create a differentiation products versus other key competitors. On the other hand, cost leadership strategy is not really viable as well because the market is immensely competitive with large-scale manufacturer like Tesla & BYD. The fact that they opened factories and has the biggest market in China proves that the market is price-sensitive and they achieved economy of scale. It remains a question that whether Dyson can achieve MES or not. Also, from 2021 to Q3'22, the market leadership switched starkly from Tesla to BYD, thanks to the Chinese market, solidify this hypothesis.

* Dyson has great brand credentials for making high quality and premium household appliance and they plan to use this credentials for their EV brand. It is questionable that whether it's transferrable or not. I assume the set of needs or attributes that EV customers are looking for is very different from household appliance's customers. We would need to conduct brand power survey between Dyson and Tesla, BWM, Volkswagen, etc. to testify this hypothesis. However, their premium image can't aid much to their power because premiumness is also a strong attribute for these EV manufacturers (Tesla, BMW, Volkswagen).",6,"I'd like to know some of the followings:

* The cost structure of the cloud infrastructure in general & of Oracle's cloud infrastructure in particular. I assume the biggest cost component is the infrastructure building itself and is pretty much standardized across players in the market (Amazon, Microsoft, Google & Alibaba). Then next components would be SG&A, Marketing & Sales & After-sales service, if Oracle is able to trim down these costs while still gaining customers and staying competitive in the market via low-price propositions then I would agree it has a cost leadership advantage.

* I'd also like to know the nature of cloud infrastructure product. Is it an undifferentiated or highly differentiated product? If it is an undifferentiated product, then there's no differentiation advantage in terms of product offering across key competitors. Then cost leadership can be a viable strategy to pursue. Another thing is the cost to exit or to change suppliers for customers, if it doesn't cost much to switch suppliers, then it's easier for Oracle to grow because customers are not locked in with their current service provider.

* Willingness-to-pay of customers is also important and whether they would switch to other competitors when Oracle starts to raise the price is an important thing to look at. How's the overall price trending and the forecasting growth rate for cloud infrastructure industry?",5,"* The property developer has chosen to pursue the differentiation strategy by entering the super-premium customer segment that owns lavish car and has a high passion/admiration for their rare car collection. The developer has strategically chose to:

*

* Associate its estate with Porsche brand, a high-end luxury car brand that portrait the lifestyle and wealthiness of its owners.

* Explicitly targeted to its niche customers and alienated other segments (for example: no pedestrian access).

* Differentiated in the elevator construction & design (the product offer) via the Dezervator. Frankly, it's just an elevator but it allows the condo owner to show-off or view and admire their luxurious/limited car in their own house. It's a statement of lifestyle and stature. So strictly speaking, they're not creating value.

* The differentiation strategy creates huge customer surplus and the developer is indeed claiming value by raising the price of the condos. Assuming all of the condos are selling at the bottom price, which is $4 million, the total revenue of the project is $528 million. This is a 10% profit to their investment. If the price is $18 million/condo (assume the average price between $4 - $32 million), then the profit is nearly 400%.",5,TRUE,1,19,3,75

 ",11,"Corteva Enlist E3 is the herbicide designed to combat hard-to-kill weeds for soybean crop growers who are dissatisfied with the current mainstream product's spraying limitations relating to the product drifting in summer heat and potentially harm neighboring crops. Corteva provides a weedkiller without the drifting problems and therefore, not restricted by some states. It is unclear what price point Corteva will use.

Even though the data in the case suggests that Monsanto's Roundup is still the main player in the market with 90% market share, in which 45-50% being the specific product with the drifting problem, Corteva is in the position to gain some market share with its Enlist E3. 

* The herbicide supplier market is concentrated, with market leaders cornering 70% market share in corn and soybeans. Therefore, growers only have few choices and less power to bargain.

* Competition between the market leaders are fierce, mainly on the R&D front. It is unclear if pricing is a part of the competition. However, Corteva might be able to increase customers' willingness to pay.

* Growers' loyalty seems to be weak. Long-term contracts with high switching cost are unlikely in this field. With the regulations, growers are even more motivated to switch to better products to comply better with the law and avoid headaches and liabilities.

* Marketing: Corteva is communicating the exact differences between its product and the competitors', backed by researches and studies. This helps growers clearly focus on the competitive advantage of Enlist E3. Without pricing info (which is likely not the most important factor anyway), the product performance is the deciding factor.

Overall, Corteva has found a differentiation strategy based on its offering that is valuable and rare, (for now) difficult to replicate, a result of systemic choice of activities (operations, marketing, R&D, etc) and whose difference is perceptible and verifiable by customers.",8,"Dyson needs to pay close attention to the following areas:

* Learning curve: Dyson has committed to a 3-year time-to-market. This is a really quick turnaround compared to other companies' years of developing their e-vehicle. Even though Dyson already makes components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries, it is still a new entrants and will face a stiff learning curve to produce complete vehicles. Dyson has a strong engineering team that has a reputation for innovation, and its success depends on whether they can transfer these skills to building EV.

* Customer loyalty: Dyson is a well-known and prestigious brand for consumer products. Its reputation for excellent quality is likely to carry over as hype for the new vehicle brand. However, whether it could live up to the reputation is a different story. Dyson will face the risk of alienating its core customers if the performance of its vehicle does not meet expectation, posing questions whether it might have lost its engineering innovation edge.

* Access to distribution: Other EV manufacturers have had years to build their distribution channels and sales team, along with charging stations and manufacturing location. This does not only require an enormous monetary investment, but also calls for market knowledge and meticulous strategic planning. Dyson has current distribution channels for its products, but it is unlikely that EV buyers will utilize those exact channels. Dyson needs to focus on developing key relationships with retailers.",5,"To certify that Oracle has a cost leadership competitive advantage, I would need to know the following about Oracle, benchmarked against industry average and key competitors, going back 5 years:

* Gross margin: to deduce manufacturing efficiency and marketing effectiveness, which are important for Oracle to sustain its strategy.

* Operating margin: how efficient Oracle is operating compared to others.

* SG&A/sales ratio: how Oracle is spending marketing dollars compared to others. Oracle might choose to spend less on marketing than industry average.

* COGS/sales ratio: how Oracle is managing cost directly related to sales. This could be due to efficient sourcing.

* Profit margin: measure profitability and effective operations management. This can indicate Oracle's pricing strategy and how well Oracle controls costs. Higher profit margin means that every sale at Oracle brings more $ to the bottom line.

* Asset turnover: how efficient Oracle uses its assets to generate income. Higher asset turnover means more $ in sales are generated per asset Oracle owned.

* Average selling price, discount: see if Oracle is the low-cost choice and if they offer promotion to attract cost-sensitive buyers.

* Sales growth rate YOY and CAGR: this will show if Oracle's strategy has been successful in increasing sales for the company

* Market share shifts: successful cost leadership should translate to Oracle stealing more market share from competitors over time.

* Margin growth rate: If Oracle is successful at building a moat, its margin should grow overtime because cost is pushed lower, and Oracle can claim more value from economic surplus.",10,"The property developers for the Porsche Design Tower in Miami have adopted a differentiation strategy. They have created value through:

* Marketing: put premium branding on the condominium. This generates a higher willingness-to-pay for customers who are already wealthy (can afford Porsche) and align their values with the Porsche brand. Because this is their home, it is likely that they also adopt an identity related to Porsche. Porsche team is also being clear in their attempt to transfer design principles to the world of real estate.

* Service: condo owners can admire their car right outside their home, and use the Deservator to conveniently get transported to their condo without having to walk to stairs or wait in elevators. This is clearly a premium service.

* R&D: The Dezervator is new and rare, both of which are likely values that align with Porsche's customers'.

-As evidenced in the exhibits provided above, the EV industry is growing rapidly ( 55K unit sales in 2011 to 6.8 million unit sales in 2021) across the globe. 
-The industry has many competitors and exhibits lower barriers to entry relatively, as evidenced by fragmented market share and # of manufacturers in China alone. 
-The industry is going through rapid disruptions as market leaders are constantly changing and tough competition is leading to market share shifts (as evidenced in market sales data from 2021 vs Q3 2022, China losing its position to BYD). 
-Dyson's $2.6 billion investment including $200 mil in R&D, as well as the 2-year timeframe to bring the car to market needs to be assessed relative to the competitors' costs and development timeframe. It's important to evaluate if Dyson's capital investment is adequate and if the 2-year timeframe is realistic for developing a new car without collaborations and the pre-existing expertise to build cars despite their ability to produce high-speed digital motors and batteries. 
Conduct: 
-Dyson should evaluate expected marketing costs and strategy relative to competitors. The firm does have a global reputation for its design and innovation capabilities but will need to identify ways to extrapolate those strengths to its EV market entry, which is extremely different from marketing household products. 
-Dyson would need to evaluate which markets to enter, who to compete with, what value proposition to offer, and what price to sell at. It would also need to identify ways to manufacture the car economically and align organizational effectiveness to compete in a market with high competitive rivalry. 
-Dyson would need to build new supply chains in a market that's already strained for adequate supply of key components. The challenges of establishing new supplier relationships would need to be carefully assessed.
Performance: 
-Dyson would need to prove its ability to innovate and elevate the design of its electric vehicle and identify ways to create value in a crowded market, especially with competitors' leveraging their deep pockets and car-making know-how. 
-It's important to assess if diversifying into the EV market is strategically beneficial to the company, and the cost of failure of this project. Dyson would need to evaluate its financial, operational, and management capacity to sustainably invest, withstand market pressure, and gain market share. ",9,"To have a cost leadership competitive advantage, Oracle's cloud infrastructure business would need to, 
1. Provide products at lower prices while offering at least similar benefits provided by competing products
2. Be able to sustain cost advantage by mitigating replication risk. 

Performance and market data would be needed to further substantiate claims of cost leadership. Some metrics to know for Oracle and its competitors would include:
-Gross margin and operating margins
-Cost structure- COGS, SGA, Logistics
-Product's average selling price, target customer demographics
-Product's market share, market share growth rate, margin growth rate. 

In the above information, while the firm and competitors' market shares and relative prices have been provided, Oracle's cost structure, growth rate and unit economics are not. It's crucial to know that information to validate its cost leadership advantage. ",10,"Financials: 
Development cost- $480 million, Units- 132, Price range- $4-32 million, Dezervator cost- $48 million
Assuming that all the units sold for at least $4 million- 4*132= $528 million.
Therefore, the project is likely profitable even at the lowest selling price of the range given. Any units sold above $4 million will create an additional economic surplus for the firm. 

By spending $48 million on the Dezervator and branding the luxury property in alignment with Porsche's design principles and target customer aspirations, the firm increased WTP for the branded real estate property. The sleek masculine design of the tower, patented elevators for direct parking access to apartments, and glass walls to allow owners to display their cars inside apartments are some ways the design and branding contribute to owners' willingness to pay premiums for the apartments. Porsche Design Tower developers created value by increasing WTP. 

By selling properties in the range of $4- $32 million, the developers are also claiming value as higher prices are increasing profits and economic surplus for the firm. 

Thus, the developers of Porsche Design Tower are both creating and claiming value. ",6,TRUE,1,20,2,86

Coterva's Enlist E3 is for soybean farmers who are tired of hard-to-kill weeds and are dissatisfied with the liability and restrictions of using Monsanto's spray. Corteva's Enlist E3 has a herbicide that can kill weeds without drifting under summer heat at a price farmers can afford.

 ",8,"Some of the key concerns of Dyson's new EV market entry strategy are:

1. The EV industry is a highly innovative industry with continuous technological development. It is also highly dependent on its suppliers- the semiconductor chip industry and high-quality labor. Daily appliances aren't as complex as producing cars. Dyson though producing a lot of the key components of an EV Vehicle will need to develop a strategy to find quality labor who can produce such vehicles and get into agreements/contracts with the other suppliers to ensure a steady supply of heavily dependent components like semiconductor chips.  Dyson will have to also take into consideration the high investment in R&D and continuous development of EV vehicles to be competitive.

2. Dyson will also need to figure out its distribution strategy. Dyson may be currently selling its high-end vacuum cleaners through retail stores/ other appliance stores. EV vehicles will need to be sold through other mediums than their current lines to reach their target consumers. They may have to invest in building showrooms or enter into deals with other places where cars are bought.

3. Dyson will also need to figure out its target customer and target demography. The China and US have good EV Setups with charging stations but are highly competitive markets with intense competition from local companies. The UK and the rest of Europe though have a share of EV markets, may require additional investment in maintaining EV vehicles and installing charging stations. The lack of provisions to charge and maintain vehicles will deter people from buying such vehicles. Moreover, installing charging stations in these countries will make the market lucrative for other EV manufacturers and Dyson will need a competitive advantage to stand out.",6,"To conclusively prove that Oracle has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage over a temporary price lowering, we would need to understand if Oracle is providing a unique and valuable service, such that, if it were to disappear then no one could replace it perfectly and also if Oracle has integrated all its activities in a way that distinguishes it from its rivals and gets the full range of essence of competitive advantage.

We would analyze the following:

1.  The key Financial and Operating Metrics for Oracle- Oracle's Gross Margin, Operating Margin, and their key cost structures. What is their biggest cost component, their biggest point of difference in cost as against their competitors?  If Oracle is simply placing its costs below the competition by reducing its net margin then they do not have a cost-leadership and can be easily under-cut by competition.

2. The Average selling price they charge and the discount they offer relative to their competitors and their target demographics. Is Oracle marginally below the competition or severely below the competition? How price-sensitive are its target customers and how is Oracle creating value for them?  Can Oracle keep up with the changes in customer demand and preferences?

3. Market-related data like their market share shifts, and margin growth rates. How is the market share /industry trending? If the industry is shifting towards low-cost value then how sustainable is Oracle's cost advantage?  

 

 ",10,"The Porsche Design Tower is creating value through both creating value and claiming value for its towers.

 

The Porsche design towers have created value by including a new innovative Dezervator in the towers. The Dezervator is a first of its kind and gives the option for buyers to see their cars even at home. All of this will add to the unique experience of a customer and increase the Willingness to Pay for its customers.

The Porsche design towers have also claimed value for their buildings. They have priced their homes at exorbitantly high rates owing to their brand value. They have named their towers after their very successful highly recognized luxury car Porsche to claim higher prices for their condominium units.

 

Their selling price is estimated to be very close to the consumer's willingness to pay, leaving little consumer surplus.

Strategic selection of sites that would allow for easy delivery of offsite constructed elements",11,"Corteva's full Value proposition statement would likely have been: 

For soybean farmers/growers in the US who are dissatisfied with weedicides that have issues with spray restrictions, potential liabilities from it and want more freedom to use the weedicide, Corteva's Enlist E3 provides soybean-and-spray combination weedicide which doesn't drift with the wind and can be sprayed in fields to combat weeds without any restrictions.

Corteva in this way has been strategic in timely exploiting the weakness and limitations in its main competitor's product. It has focused its efforts in gaining market share in the following ways:

1. Focus on R&D and innovative product development: Corteva launched a unique soybean-and-spray combination in 2019 based around a herbicide named 2,4-D Choline. Unlike Monsanto's dicamba based solution, Enlist E3 does not have the same issues with wind drift as verified by various studies and field work done by university agricultural researchers. This innovation addressed a critical pain point for the farmers concerned with herbicide drift and associated liabilities.

2. Effective identification and solution to existing market problem - Monsanto's herbicide has been known to evaporate off crops and drift in the wind which can cause damage to neighbouring crops lacking resistance to dicamba. Corteva's solution doesn't cause this problem thus providing a safer and more reliable solution to the farmers.

3. Regulatory advantage - Due to issues with Dicamba, some states have imposed restrictions on when it can be sprayed on crops (or its duration of usage). Corteva capitalised on these restrictions, thus expanding its market opportunity and appealing to farmers who were dissuaded from using Monsanto's product due to the restrictions

4. Marketing and communication - Corteva effectively communicated its value proposition to its target market. At an August farm show in Decatur, Ill., Corteva higglighted the absence of spraying limitations associated with its product directly comparing it to Monsato's product through its slogan ""I have the freedom to spray"" thus creating a clear differentiation strategy.",6,"In assessing the likely success of Dyson's new EV market entry strategy, the following considerations and critical areas of concern should be addressed:

1. Operations -Manufacturing and production capability - Even though Dyson has a historical record of manufacturing high quality consumer appliances, automobile industry is fundamentally and radically different. The transition to automobile manufacturing requires integration of vast complex assembly lines, safety standards and supply chain management. Rare earth metals like Lithium is a critical component of manufacturing, and it would important to assess Dyason's ability to efficiently scale up production and synergize the complex processes with its in house capabilities.

2. Technological innovation and differentiation - Dyson has a track record of bringing a fresh perspective to existing market products, EVs require cutting edge technologies, battery management systems, autonomous driving enhancement through tons of data for machine learning. To compete with industry incumbents like Tesla, BYD, Volkwagen group, Dyson would need to differentiate its product or demonstrate a significant technological advantage that sets it apart in terms of range, performance and  driving features.

3.  Market positioning and distribution - Even if Dyson is able to create a product with substantially differentiated and advance features, it needs to assess consumer preferences and establish distribution channels. It needs to strategically gain access to various distribution channels that would enable it to effectively reach its target customer segments and position itself effectively to its competitors.",6,"To verify if Oracle's cloud business genuinely uses cost leadership as an advantage, assessment of the following aspects would be required:

1. Cost structure analysis - Benchmark monthly unit costs of cloud services for both B2C and B2B products against its competitors like AWS, Azure and Google cloud (Google One) would help in understanding oracle's relative cost position. Focusing on main cost drivers and business activities that lead to it, and how they compare to the competitors would help in accurately assessing if Oracle's advantages are temporary or sustainable.

2. Performance and quality evaluation - Benchmarking Oracle's cloud services reliability, features with AWS, Azure and google cloud would enable effective comparison of the service offerings across the players and would help assess any compromised in quality of service offering.

3. Market share and growth - Analysing's Oracle's market share growth and ability to attract potential customers would show effective cost leadership strategy. A cost leadership strategy is supposed to increase the volume of sales and thus the effective market share for the organisation.

4. Customer retention- Assessing customer retention rates and satisfaction can indicated the perceived quality of Oracle's cloud services. Low quality products wouldn't create customer loyalty and would make switching to competitors likely option.

5. Financial health and profit margin - Comparison to competitor's pricing and cost structure would validate it being economical and cost leadership shouldn't erode too much of profit margins to keep the service offering sustainable and to maintain latitude to respond to rapidly changing technology landscape",10,"In my opinion, the developers of Porsche design tower have clearly adopted a differentiation strategy in uniquely creating attributes that attract their target customer segment. This strategy is leading to the following outcomes:

1. Unique Value Creation - 

a. Innovative design - The trademark of Porsche's automobile  design is being translated to real estate creating a unique aesthetic yet functional appeal much like its luxury cars.

b. Exclusive features - The Deservator is a distinctive feature that offers a unique living experience that differentiates this property from others.

c. High end amenities - The sky high garages and lobby design further add to the luxury aura of the property creating a high end lifestyle experience.

2. Claiming value - Premium pricing - With unit prices ranging between $4 MN to $32 MN, the developer is targeting a premium segment of market with a high WTP for the unique features and brand association. This is a direct signal of value created through differentiation.

3. Brand Association - Associating with a luxury brand like Porsche automatically elevates the prestige perception of the property and is important for creating a unique value proposition.

4. Value capture - The premium pricing allows the developer to capture significant value from the unique features and brand association they have intentionally created. The substantial investment of $480 MN is aimed at capturing and targeting a high end clientele.",7.5,TRUE,1,19,3,80.5

Faster cleaning through design choices - lowers costs of cleaning services",11,"Value proposition statement - For farmers who are dissatisfied with Monsanto's offerings in the soybean seed + herbicide market, Corteva's offering provides a similar product without the regulatory and spraying hurdles at a similar (or perhaps slightly higher) price. 

How Corteva may have gained market share - 

*  Corteva has created a differentiated product - one that does not have issues of evaporation and drift that the Monsanto product has.

*  Corteva therefore has likely been able to increase their customer's WTP, due to the lack of regulatory hurdles.

*  Farmers that originally used Monsanto are likely switching to the Corteva products, increasing sales volume.

* Due to the previous 2 points, Corteva has also likely increased product pricing (this may be a safe assumption), to capture this economic surplus.

Due the previous 4 points, it is a very reasonable assumption that Corteva has gained market share by increasing a combination of WTP, volume, and perhaps price. ",7,"3 concerns of Dyson entering into the EV market

1. Since China has roughly 50% of worldwide EV sales, will Dyson be able to break into this extremely lucrative market? We must consider that it is a British company and may need to overcome regulatory barriers that the Chinese Govt imposes. Assuming that this is true, I would also like to know whether EV customers in China are more likely to buy Chinese or incentivized to buy Chinese, versus foreign imports. 

2. I would like to know Dyson's plan for investing in all areas of the supply chain - from conception, engineering, manufacturing, and distribution. As a company that makes household products, does this expertise/resources translate into making EVs? While a major component of EVs is the electric motor (which Dyson is apparently good at making), there are hundreds of other components that completely make a car (such as brakes, body frames, suspension elements, etc) that can significantly impact car performance. Not accounting for these may cause safety issues in the future with the vehicle. We must account for these since Dyson does not have expertise in these areas. 

3. I would like to know whether customers in the market will ACTUALLY buy an EV made by Dyson. While Dyson has expressed confidence in 'credentials', I would like to know the basis for these credentials. Dyson's brand recognition is built on innovative, everyday consumer electronics. However, customers may find it simply 'odd' to buy an EV made by Dyson, versus an EV made by a company such as Nissan, Chevy, or Tesla - companies that are trusted and have the auto-manufacturing know-how. Therefore I would like to know how Dyson plans to overcome this brand-image clash.",6,"Data points required for Oracle -  

* Profits and Profit Margin % - While Oracle has significantly lower prices, are they even profitable? While their revenue is on the rise, this does not indicate that they are profitable. They likely have lesser margins (than the major players in this market) since they are priced very low.

* Gross Margin - This will help provide an estimate of COGS.

* SG&A - Will provide another metric for total cost, that is considered after Gross Margin calculation

* Volume of services sold - This will help understand which element of revenue is stronger, pricing or volume.

* Asset Turnover - Help us understand how effective Oracle is at driving sales through their total assets (which Oracle has a large amount)

* Oracle Marginal and Average Costs

Market Data Points -

* CAGR for all members of the market

* Marginal and Average Costs for market members

* Differentiated costs for market members

* Differentiated marginal services that are provided as a result of a higher price from other competitors (i.e. customer service, etc) ",10,"Let's break this down into 2 parts - 

Creating Value

* VALUE IS BEING CREATED. The WTP is vastly increasing, since this looks like one of the premier properties in the area, that is also very well designed, has the Porsche labeling, and has extremely innovative features - the car elevator - that customers will be willing to pay a premium for. We may assume that the relative costs for the structure are increasing less than the relative increase in WTP.

Claiming Value

* Value is being claimed as well. Value must be claimed on a pricing perspective, and we can assume that the already high-prices are greatly increasing due to these features in the building, capturing more of the value that has been created. 

Doing some math as well - suppose the average price of a unit is $15M. Therefore revenue = 15M * 132 = $1980M. This is greater than the costs of the building. This means that there is a HUGE gross profit (~$1500M) that is made within this structure, meaning that they are likely capturing value through price increases. 

Therefore, there is both value creation and capture strategy that the tower builders are using. ",6,TRUE,1,17,5,74

For soyabean farmers who are dissatisfied with the drifting problems of dicamba and the eventual restrictions around spraying Xtend and XtendFlex in their farms, our offering Enlist E3 provides a solution to the spraying limitiation and the drifting problem

* Explanation:

* Corteva and Monsanto operate in the same market with the same target customer (soyabean farmers)

* Monsanto's product with dicamba has several limitations:

* It evaporates and eventually drifts in summer heat

* It also might harm neighbouring crops which do not have a resistance to it

* As a result, the government has imposed restrictions on the spraying of this product

* This gives an opportunity for Corteva as:

* Its product Enlist E3 doesn't drift. And hence doesn't cause the same problems as Monsanto's product causes 

* Corteva has used this as their point of differentiation in their marketing strategy",5.5,"The three key areas of concern that I have with Dyson's entry to the EV market are:

* Resources/ Capabilities: 

* Car Manufacturing is a very complex process. It requires designing of the car, sourcing components, identifying sources of the components, establishing proper supply chains, building manufacturing facilities

* Dyson needs to ensure that they have the right team/ talent/ human resources to design their cars. Getting the right people with the right expertise is a challenge given the fairly novel nature of EV technology

* This whole venture requires significant capital expenditure – Dyson has to have a plan for contingencies given the dependence of the industry on suppliers

* Supplier Power is high as it was evident during the semiconductor chip shortage. As EV requires chips, such shortages can cause bottlenecks

* Economies of Scale:

* Launching a new car requires billions of dollars in capital expenditure

* Dyson needs to grow fast enough to reach MES - minimum efficient scale

* Brand recognition:

* Major markets currently in the world are China, Germany, and USA while other emerging markets also increasingly growing in this space

* Dyson needs to identify and choose which would be the best target market to enter as it cannot enter all markets

* And it also needs to build its image as a car manufacturer as people currently associate it as a home appliance brand",5,"* We would need the following metrics:

* Net margin of Oracle and Competitors: This would be crucial to understand if Oracle is making any profit on its sales

* To compute this we need operating expenses data - COGS, SGA, logistics data

* Even though Oracle has a low cost structure, we need to compare its cost structure with the ratios of its prices to the competitors to understand if it is capturing the value it creates

* Ease of integration metric: This would be helpful to understand how seamlessly Oracle's cloud services integrate with a given firm's exisiting infrastructure

* Market Growth: We need to compare Oracle's sales growth rate with the market growth rate to understand if it is keeping up with the market growth rate ot losing its share or growing very slowly",10,"* The property developers seem to have adopted the differentiation strategy.

* They are trying to increase the perceived value to the end customer by differentiating themselves through building new features such as the Dezervator, design of the building itself - it has the same sleek, souped-up masculine energy of the cars, no dedicated pedestrian access

* As per the estimate, the developers have spent 10% of the building cost – this number comes out to be 10% of $480 million = 48 Million. That is a significant percentage of their overall cost. This indicates that they are trying to increase customer's perceived value and hence WTP by increasing their cost. They are trying to increase the customer's WTP without increasing costs by the same amount

* They have also patented that elevator - this process would have also added to their costs. They would now try to use this point to increase the perceived value when they market their building to potential customers.

Hence, I believe that the property developers are trying to go down the route of differentiating themselves and increasing customer's WTP without increasing the cost incurred by the same amount.",8,TRUE,1,19,3,80.5

Although they have fusing innovative engineering  and design to provide fresh takes on every day appliances, car market is very different with house hold appliance market.  

So, they have to figure out three most critical issue to suceed in new market.

First, they have to think about initiation investment amout. 

They will face the cost and risk of creating large scale capacity to start with or a severe cost disadvantage because they invest too much. (ex. $2.6B total)

Second, they have to consider the incumbents relationship.

Dyson is a new entrants, they will face a risk of relation from the incumbents which could occur immediately on large scale and start a price war as a deterrent of their entry. 

Third, they also have to think about customer needs and incumbent's knowhow.

Before taking the project Dyson have to do research about customer needs and have to make how they attractive customer who have high loyalty to incumbent company.

Can Dyson get the Economy of Scale (EoS) for the EV business?

   - Dyson can build up its EoS, with sufficient capital from their profitable existing business (e.g. home appliance)

   - However, manufacturing EVs can be different, needing more and different components than home appliance products.

   - Dyson should make up a strong supply chain for the procurement of key components such as semiconductor chips and large batteries.

   - Since it is Dyson's first time to manufacture such sizable products, the EV business can cause long learning curve in manufacturing efficiency. Dyson should hire experts in this field to avoid in-line problems.

 

2. Does Dyson have easy access to input resources and distribution?

   - EVs are now regarded as one of electronic devices, and the electronic engines are the most important component.

   - Dyson has long history R&D in the home appliance business, meaning it has sufficient engineering capability to develop EVs. Dyson has advanced technology of electronic engines adapted to home appliance products, with multiple patents.

   - Also, Dyson's products are often perceived that they have great design, meaning the firm has design talents.

   -  Dyson's current products are selling worldwide, meaning the firm has a wide channel to sell its product. It will help the distribution of their EVs.

 

3. Does the EV customers have strong brand loyalty?

   - Many analysts say Tesla has a strong brand loyalty. Chinese brands may be attractive to their local people due to nationalism.

   - Dyson has a popular and premium brand image in the home appliance market. It can be beneficial to spread press release of their brand new EV. But at the very first, Dyson should overcome their current image as 'a home appliance maker'.

Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range.

Some part of the construction process was expected to be done offsite.

Brightly-colored lobbies with a self-serve market area where guests can get drinks like Craft beer and food.

The overall footprint of the property is smaller

The lobby also boasts recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work.

 

Tru hotels have a lobby that is more than 80% larger than Hilton’s typical Hampton Inn location, which is priced slightly higher than Tru. 

 

The rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. 

Rationale

Being away from city centers helps Tru keep its land costs lower, ultimately with the aim of delivering sufficient returns to convince developers that building new hotels in that price range.

Smaller rooms generate more revenue per square feet. Smaller overall property keeps costs lower. The rooms are designed to make cleaning easier and faster, requiring lesser manpower to maintain the property. All of this is done with the aim of delivering sufficient returns to convince developers that building new hotels in that price range.

The design of the lobby, however, is such that the hotel resembles a boutique brand generally found in a trendy, urban location. The purpose is to expand its customer base and differentiate itself from competitors in the same price range. 

The aim of this choice is to keep costs down with the aim of delivering sufficient returns to convince developers that building new hotels in that price range.

The purpose is to differentiate itself from competitors in the same price range. 

 ",11,"Value Proposition Statement - For soybean farmers who are dissatisfied with spray restrictions on Monsanto's Dicamba, Corteva's Enlist E3's technological prowess provides the freedom to spray at a similar price. 

Based on the statement above, Corteva has been able to sell its products to dissatisfied farmers, who were already fearful of the headaches and liability that came along with Monsanto's spray. This was further exacerbated by the limits on the spray placed by some states, which further dissuaded some growers from using Monsanto’s product. Given that the same problems did not exist for Corteva;s product, Corteva was easily able to market its product using this point of differentiation and as such, gain market share. ",7.5,"* Technical Expertise

We understand that Dyson has made a mark around the globe by fusing innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances such as vacuum cleaners, fans and hand dryers. However, does that mean that Dyson has enough technical expertise to venture into electric car manufacturing, which requires a much different level of capabilities specifically in engineering, design, manufacturing, and adhering to regulatory / safety standards. Dyson will need to invest in the capabilities required organically or inorganically to meet the requirements of gaining the requisite technical expertise to ramp up. 

* Competition

The EV market is very crowded with incumbent players like Tesla, Chinese manufacturers, as well as traditional automotive companies, which are all venturing into electric vehicle design and manufacturing. These companies have enough cash reserves and proven technical expertise to continue to build new and innovative products. Moreover, these companies already have relationships with suppliers, manufacturing / assembly plants, and distribution channels required to operate in this industry. Even though Dyson has pledged to invest EUR 2 billion in the program, the amount of competition and the level of entrenchment by the traditional players in the supply chain will make it difficult for Dyson to build the required elements to effectively operate in this industry. 

* Brand Values and Perception

Dyson is a very well known brand for home electric appliances like vacuum cleaners and hair dryers. Even though complimentary manufacturing activities exist such as building motors, the concern here is that the perception of the brand as a home appliance manufacturer may not fit well with an electric car manufacturer. The ability of Dyson to create market acceptance for its brand in the electric vehicle market will be a critical determinant of its success. ",7,"* We need to understand the per unit revenue generated by Oracle as well as its competitors.

According to article, we cannot find out how Corteva came up with pricing idea. However, it is very clear that Corteva is trying to get market share from Monsanto by mentioning ""I have freedom to spray"".",6.5,"There are three critical areas of concern about Dyson entering EV market.

1. Supply Chain Management issue

Considering Dyson was well-known for small appliances such as vacuum cleaner, fans, and hand dryers, they are now used to supply chain management for huge ones like cars. Especially, when is comes to logistic issue and services provided in off-line sites, Dyson currently does not have capabilities from time zero. Since other major players also do not own shipping company or actual ships, Dyson might have capability to make partnerships with shipping lines, but they have to input a lot of resources to it. The reason is that most of major players already have stable demand which allows them to operate regular distribution channels but Dyson won't have regular cargo or stable demand from the beginning.

2. Infrastructure of vendors

When we think of car manufaturing industry, most of major players including Tesla mainly operate final assembly line in their own plant. Normally, most of car manufacturers operate partner vendors. In industry they devide into few segments. In most cases they devide into from Tier 1 to Tier 3. Tier 3 makes basic parts and supply to Tier 2, and Tier 2 make more complex parts with raw materials they received from Tier 3 and then supply to Tier 1 vendors. And, Tier 1 vendors makes parts which can be assembled in main manufacturing line. Considering major players built relationship and infrastructure over decades, Dyson has to input huge amount to resourses to develop such infrastructure. Since manufacturing small appliances and EV will be significant different, Dyson need to develop from nothing. We can say that Dyson will face huge challenge since they now do not have capability and they have to input massive resources on it.

3. Cost Structure

Car manufaturing industry is considered one of the most difficult industry to make market entry. This is not only because there should be huge equity input but also it takes years to reach economy of scale. If Dyson starts manufacturing operation without enough regular demand, it is obvious that Dyson has to face higher per unit cost compared to competitors. Also, considering Dyson does not have regular model line-ups, this will also boost up cost for Dyson. In order to reach similar or better cost structure compared to competitors, Dyson must endure time while they expand market share and make soft-landing. However, since earning market share or making soft-landing is not guaranteed, Dyson cannot be sure that this enduring time can be compensated. This time will cost Dyson huge load of money. Therefore, Dyson might have resource to go through this enduring time but we are not sure if Dyson has capability to reach certain market share or demand to reach cost competitiveness.",4,"A firm is said to have a competitive advantage over its rivals if the firm can generate wide range of WTP(Price + Consumer Surplus) or lowering cost.

The main value that Corteva's product provides is the ability to spray the herbicide with no repercussions on neighboring non resistance crops due to evaporation from product and drift from wind in the summer time. Allowing farmers to spray the herbicide freely. ",7.5,"The three most critical areas of concern for Dyson: 

1) Gaining Credibility with consumers - as a new player Dyson will be competing with established EV producers that have established customers who wont be willing to switch due to high switching costs because of lack of infrastructure(charging stations) and lack of knowledge/ trust in product. Dyson would have to invest heavily in marketing to gain credibility with customers who see them as a home appliance company. Dyson will have to change their branding and establish a value proposition that differentiates them from their competitors. 

2) Competing with local manufacturers in countries with high electric car manufacturing to gain market share - around 50% of the EV market is located in China. China already has 100's of EV companies with 300 models total. Breaking in to this market is nearly impossible due to barriers to distribution access and suppliers access. For the US market, Tesla who is the top selling EV manufacturer has market share of 12.6% globally and revenue which Dyson can't compete with. 

3) Technology and engineering required to build cars - as a newcomer who has never made cars Dyson will have to spend heavily on R & D and testing (200 million pounds). While they do have the resources and they do make components of electric cars like the battery and and high speed motors, they might have to outsource for other components of the car and suppliers for those components might not be willing to switch from their existing customers. Dyson's main advantage here is their ability to make batteries for battery EV's which account for 71% of EV sales. ",6,"To determine Oracle's cost leadership competitive advantage in the market we would need to know the following things: 

1) # of customers(volume/units sold for Oracle and its competitors) - showing the increase in revenue is due to demand being higher because of Oracles competitive positioning( having low price)

2) cost structure of Oracle(breakdown of cost of operations, SG&A, gross profit, net profit, advertising, distribution costs and channels) - shows one segment or element of cost breakdown that is giving Oracle a cost advantage

3) prices of competitors and WTP of customers - showing that Oracle is pricing lower than competitors even when WTP is high, to gain market share.

4) cost structure of competitors(operating costs, operating income, SG &A, sales revenue, gross profit) - shows that competitors cost structure is higher than Oracles cost structure 

5) global market share data of the Cloud infrastructure market over time showing that Oracle's market share is increasing",10,"The property developers of Porsche Design Tower definitely are creating value by using a differentiation strategy. They have created a building that resembles the sleek and masculine energy of a Porsche. The Dezervator highlights the Porsche car by having it sit in front of each unit with glass walls so owners can gaze at their Porsche when they are home fitting with the Porsche brand and highlighting the Porsche car its main product. The demand for Porsche Design Tower is clearly high as people are willing to pay $4 to $32 million for each unit which means that Porsche is providing a unique and valuable experience by the Dezervator and the building's design that cannot be replicated hence increasing the WTP from customers. 

To understand if Porsche Design Tower is capturing value we would need to understand more about the costs structure associated with the Porsche Tower and the maintenance cost. If we assume the avg price of $14 million (midpoint) x 132 unit = $1848 million in revenue. If we assume the cost of development is the only cost then  $1848 - $480 million = $1368 million profit. If these calculations are assumed it is possible that Porsche is capturing value by keeping the price high and holding costs relatively low and WTP constant. ",9,TRUE,1,17,5,76.5

Our offering provides the spraying convenience to safely kill pesky weeds while also ensuring the safety of neighboring crops that our sprays may unintentionally come into contact with. Our offering price provides savings through minimizing damage and waste to crop supply.",5,"Threats of retaliation from current incumbents: As mentioned above, Dyson will be competing with competitors with deep pockets. Specifically, Tesla has been known to offer continuous price cuts on vehicle models as a means to defend and grow its market share in the EV space.

 

Large financial resources needed: It was stated above that Dyson planned to spend £2 billion on the expansion into the EV space with £200 million allocated specifically to R&D. This is a startup costs that will likely be unrecoverable even if the venture is not fruitful. Global market leader, Tesla, invests heavily in R&D spend and the EV market is characterized by R&D competition on battery longevity and self-driving technology. There will need to be continued R&D investment for Dyson to successfully compete with Tesla and other large EV makers and they will still likely remain behind. Lastly, the auto industry is subject to labor unions which can lead to higher costs. Entry into this market may cut down on potential profits for Dyson if its employees unionize or it has to pay high premium wages to employees to not unionize.

Incumbency advantages independent of size: Large EV makers have efficiently scaled their production process. EV players like Tesla will likely already have strong supplier connections, such as agreements with chipmakers to supply chips, which are critical in auto production and carry long lead times due to strong demand and capacity constraints. Lastly, as mentioned above many current large players likely have proprietary battery and or self-driving technology which will be costly for Dyson to catch up to (if possible).",6,"There are four key analysis I would like to review in order to prove if Oracle has a cost leadership competitive advantage:

Key cost structure vs. industry average: If Oracle's cost structure is meaningfully lower than the recent historical industry average, then this could be indicative of a cost leadership competitive advantage.

Key cost structure vs. Amazon Google, AWS & Alibaba: Similar to above, an analysis of Oracle's cost structure vs. industry leaders will be useful in understanding if they truly have a cost leadership competitive advantage. Moreso, understanding how Oracle's spend differs from the top industry leaders and identifying which activities or services Oracle chooses to omit from their business offerings or do differently from other top players to save money will also be insightful.

Oracle's target customer demographics: Assuming cloud services is largely a B2B market, I would expect Oracle to serve more smaller to mid-size business that are likely more price-sensitive than larger firms and corporations.

Gross margin and operating margin: Positive margins as well as continued margin growth (especially if it is outpacing or moving inversely to overall industry margin trends) would also help prove if Oracle had genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market.",5,"Based off the information above, I believe Porsche is both creating value and and claiming value thus creating an economic surplus.

 

Creating value: Customers in the name brand luxury condominium market are not price sensitive. Instead they are focused on exclusivity, elevated experiences and pride. Porsche's thoughtful design, hot geographic location and attention to creating unique, likely unrivaled, experiences like the Dervator caters to everything this customer segment demands. Specifically, the ~$48M spent on the Dezervator demonstrates Porsche's commitment to adding value to the name brand luxury condominium market, thus increasing this customer's willingness to pay.

 

Claiming value: I believe Porsche is also claiming value because because of the premium price it is commanding. Additionally, the average cost per unit is ~$3.6M which is ~$0.4M lower than the starting the starting unit price of $4M and ~$28.4M less than the highest unit price of $32M. Therefore Porsche is claiming value through claiming a pretty profit margin on condo unit sales.",5.5,TRUE,1,19,3,72.5

I would assume that they are not claiming this value for a few reasons. First, I don't actually know if they have been successful in attracting residents that are seeking this additional service. I can imagine that most luxury car drivers are conditioned and okay with having there car valleyed, or a designated parking spot that isn't terribly inconvenient for the owner. Thus, I don't know if there are capturing a large market that are WTP for this premium service. Secondly, the name being Porsche Tower could also eliminate part of the luxury market drivers that don't like Porsche or are brand loyal to other luxury car models.

The capability of mass-production

  - Even though Dyson will invest more than $2.6 Billion into this project, having the capability for mass production could be a real problem. For EV market, there are large dinosaurs such as Tesla (ranked 1st position in the market, when excluding China), which already have the capability to produce nearly 1 million a year (market sales data from 2021). Since EV market has been growing very rapidly, the economics of scale are seriously required for new entrants like Dyson to survive. When we consider Tesla's recent aggressive price-down strategies, Dyson needs large scales to compete with the market leader. Also, Dyson has to build new sourcing channels and relationships for suppliers to procure major components, such as automobile frames (made with complex of materials, such as iron, carbon, copper, etc.), tires, semiconductors, etc, which can be also barriers for Dyson.

 

2. Lack of know-how in manufacturing automobile

  - As Dyson said it won’t collaborate with other car makers, this can be a serious problem. Unlike home applications, manufacturing automobiles requires an extreme level of reliability since it is directly related to human life, and also needs the understanding of more complex engineering due to its nature, using more than millions of parts to make a car. Now, simply Dyson doesn't have this kind of know-how, so it will cost Dyson tremendous of cost and time to optimize its production line and product to ""Dyson Quality"". 

 

3. Design, the most well-known attractive value of Dyson, is not enough for EV market.

  - Although Dyson has been well known for its innovative engineering and design, it cannot guarantee Dyson to succeed, because those features are relatively easy to copy. For example, when comparing BYD's recent models with those of Tesla or Volkswagen, most customers cannot distinguish or at least hard to notice major differences in design. With the highly-standardized performance of EVs these days, the last comer, Dyson, may face high hurdles if it relies on its unique design.

Based on assessing the information present the following challenges that Dyson will need to address to compete in the market are:

* Market Demand - UK has sales for the EV market were 327K which was comparatively lower than China and US combined. Germany also had a stronger sales of EV cars in 2021 of nearly double than the UK. This may be a huge drawback for Dyson to sell in its local market.

* Market Entry - Chinese manufactures and Tesla, are currently the market leaders in this space, 3/5 of the top global EV brands are Chinese manufactures and Tesla has the highest sales in the US and is ranked second globally. Will Dyson have the budget and resources to enter into the market and gain market share? 

* Brand Value - Dyson's brand value is tied to household appliances such as vacuum cleaners, fans, hair dryers, Dyson will need to change customer perceptions to shift their view as a EV manufacturer? Will Dyson go under a different brand name? How will it allow customers to trust and create value to sell EV's in the market? 

Overcoming these barriers of entry will be critical for Dyson in order to enter the EV industry. ",2,"Oracle claims it is cheaper than the market leaders, showcasing a cost leadership competitive advantage. In order to able to claim a cost leadership advantage, Oracle must also have a high profit margin. 

In order to confirm that Oracle is creating value and not giving it away to customers we require: 

Financial Operating Metrics: We would need oracles, gross margins and operating margins. As well as its Key cost structures such as COGS, SGA, logistics. 

Product and Services: What is oracles Average Selling price of the product, and its price discount and what services does it add on and extra charges for those services. 

Market metrics: We have Oracles the sales and market share metrics with a 66% sales growth and a total market share 2% of the overall cloud business. We would also need to see Margin growth rate to determine how much ititss profiting with low costs year over year. 

Using these metrics we can determine if the low cost structure for Oracle is claiming/ capturing value for the company of if they're simply giving the value away to customers.

 ",6.5,"Key Concern 1. Dyson's ability to survive in the China market (Porter's force: bargaining power of buyer's): China is the largest buyer of EVs. China already has three establisted EV producers BYD, Wuling, and GAC group. Chinese customers usually highly  value nationalistic sentiments and so they would rather buy a car from a chinese manufactuter than a foreign one. Dyson is a British companty and so they will not be able to generate and capitalize on that nationalistic sentiment that BYD, Wuling, and GAC group enjoy in China and so will not be able to compete. 

Key Concern 2: Time/investment required to reach Minimum effiecient scale (Porter's force: threat of entry): EV is a investment heavy industry and established players are already enjoying economies of scale. By the time Dyson catches on, these players can outprice Dyson from the market. There may also be existing patents and technology know-hows which deters entry to the industry.

Key Concern 3: Ability to survive competitve rivalry (Porter's force: competitve rivalry): high fixed cost to variable cost industry. Players are incentivized to reduce prices to gain market share. Most players are also likely to have extra capacity to quickly adjust to increased demand. ",3,"To ascertain Oracle's supposed cost leadership strategy, there are some key financial metrics we would need for Oracle and other industry players (Amazon, Google). 

Profitability metrics: Gross margin, operating margin, net margin

Key cost structure components: COGS, SG&A, Logistics 

We would also need to check the fixed to variable cost ratio split for the companies. 

Product/service metrics: such as average selling price

Oracle only has a genuine cost leadership advantage if it is able to produce the same product as Amazon/google at a lower cost per unit. This can be ascertained by comparing the cost structure components across the companies. 

However Oracle's lower prices might not be a reflection of a true cost leadership advantage rather a ploy to gain market share by outpricing competitors. This is possible if Oracle has a high fixed to variable cost ratio relative to it's competitors and so is incentivized to gain market share by reducing prices to bring in volume to recoup the fixed costs.

Number of units = 132

It could take years to see returns (if they are successful in breaking into the market).

2. EV customers have already established loyalties (i.e. in U.S. Tesla, in China BYD). It would be difficult to get customers open to a new electric car when these brand are already so engrained in customers minds. The advertising/marketing budget would need to be high.

Suburban highway exits:

* By selecting less flashy locales like suburban highways, Tru is positioning itself to be easily accessible to its target customers who are at the lower end of the market and looking to pay less than $100. I imagine this group to be customers who are on road trips just needing a cheaper place to stay off the side of the road. 

20% smaller rooms:

* By charging a lower amount per night, the decision to also reduce the size of the hotel room aligns with a lower-cost strategy

* By making smaller rooms, Tru will reduce the building cost per room since the space is smaller which will require less material spend 

Offsite building:

* By having some part of the construction process done offsite, Tru is reducing the cost of construction and therefore can be positioned to provide rooms are a lower cost rate. 

* Hilton being a leader in constructing hotels can save costs by taking certain activities in their value chain off-site because it has the expertise to know which activities to take offsite.

 

Large lobby: 

* Choosing to make smaller rooms, it's a trade-off personal space but providing large lobbies for customers. When the customer walks in, it will not feel like it's trading off space given the lower-priced hotel rate.

Away from big city centers to keep land cost down:

* Choosing suburban locations away from big cities helps keep the land cost down which reduces cost compared to building in more expensive flashy areas where real estate has a higher price tag. Since buying land is a bucket of cost, choosing lower-cost land aligns with their cost leadership strategy.

No desk:

* By designing a smaller room design, deciding to not include a desk is also a way to reduce cost per room because it requires one less furniture expense

Build more rooms

Self-serve markets:

* As a trade-off to not having a full service restaurant in it's hotel, Tru is providing a smaller space through self-serve markets where customers can have access to food and drinks which is important because of it's suburban location off the side of highways there might not be many food or drink options available especially late at night 

* No desk/no coffee choices align with the customer target who is willing to pay less per room and therefore expects fewer bells and whistles per room 

 

Individual working space

- Since Tru is removing desks from rooms, the tradeoff is to provide individual working spaces in the recreational hotel space so customers who need a working space, will still have it. 

Easier and faster cleaning:

* Tru is still committed to providing clean rooms by reducing the amount of items it has in each room which will allow housekeeping to clean easier and faster. An example of a material that will also help in this is choosing vinly floors  vs carpet.

Who are dissatisfied with..spray limitations offered by competitor's spray.

Our offering provides... competing soybean and spray combinations that allow the freedom to spray without worrying about it drifting away.

At a competitive price.",7.5,"Concerns

1. From a competitive advantage, one of the key points for a company to create a true advantage is to find an integrated set of choices that distinguish a firm from its rivals. In this case, Dyson did not mention which part of its manufacturing facility would be different than what its competitors are doing to truly capture a competitive advantage in this industry. Because the rivalry among existing competitors is present and high, with 5 brands taking up market share in this industry, there seems to be a disadvantage for Dyson entering a new industry that can limit the potential for profitability given its high existing rivalry among competitors. 

2. Two of the basic strategies to gain competitive advantage are differentiation and cost leadership. Based on the information provided, it is not clear on which end is Dyson planning to be competitive in this industry. In the current EV market, there is a low threat of new entrants because the learning curve of making electric cars is high, there's existing customer loyalty to current industry-leading brands, the start-up costs of getting into electric car manufacturing is high, and there's no equal access to distribution, I predict that Dyson is in a tough spot to enter this market because due to its high barriers of new entrants, it is not an attractive market to enter. Dyson needs to re-evaluate if it's competing as a differentiator in the market or cost leadership. 

3. Based on the data provided, it looks like Dyson is going against brands like Tesla that have a much stronger structure-based competitive advantage. Tesla models dominated the market of global EV sales between 2011 and 2021. Although Dyson claims resource base advantage of having experience creating innovative engineering and design for vacuum cleaners, fans, and hand dryers, that may stand true in those categories, but based on evidence of leading EV brands, it does not translate to a resource base advantage in the EV market because there are other companies that are already having success with similar manufacturing facilities. ",8,"In order to prove that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a true cost leadership competitive advantage I would need the following evidence from their financial and operating metrics:

 

Cost/profit structure: understand how margins compare to competitors, the market share shifts over time and see a comparative cost structure analysis including: 

* Compute COGS %

* SG&A overall and for each element that is broken out

* COGS and SG&A growth rate %

* Cost, price, WTP to understand economic surplus ",10," 

 

The property developers for the Porsche Design Tower in Miami have adopted a differentiation strategy to create a competitive by creating value by increasing a customer's Willingness To Pay.  By offering apartment spaces at a greater cost but with a greater perceived benefit that is having the opportunity to gaze admiringly at the customer's Porsche car that sits in the owner's apartment.  Porsche is creating value by raising WTP for a segment of consumers that have unmet needs such as wanting to drive into their apartment unit, take an elevator to their floor and park their Porsche right in front of their apartment.  Since Porsche is a high-end luxury brand, it knows there's a set of customers who perceive this difference in the value provided and therefore are willing to pay a higher price so Porsche is increasing its customer's WTP. It's tapping into a lifestyle market as a business because it's creating value that customer's are willing to pay for. ",7,TRUE,1,16,6,75.5

 ",5,"Corteva has been able to gain market share from Monsanto in the soybean seed + herbicide market on two points 1) Enlist III is a resistant soybean variety seed (2-4 D Choline ) to Monsanto's Xtend soybeans and 2) the herbicide that can be used on Enlist III has better spraying applications than Monsanto's product. For almost two decades Monsanto has held the the market for resistant variety soybean seeds; however, weeds have evolved resistant to roundup so Monsanto launched a new seed variety with Dicamba in 2017 to combat the issue. However, it was learned that Dicamba drifts upon application to soybean plants which affects other nearby crops and vegetation. Corteva launched Enlist III in 2019, which used a different herbicide formulation that had better spraying application.

I would want to know where Dyson is going to build EV's (are they setting up UK plants or outsourcing outside the country). Also, I want to know who they plan to have as their raw material suppliers. If any of these suppliers are shared by competitors this may develop a competitive rivalry for supplies that hinder their entry into the EV market. Second,  I want to know what price Dyson is considering to sell their product for. They need a competitive price that allows them to earn profit while capturing enough of the EV market to be sustainable in the future. In addition, I want to know if they are planning on increasing their pricing in the first few years of having the product out. They could be trying to release a car that is cheaper than competitors to gain market share and then increase price later to make profit. Also, I need to know the minimum selling price for a Dyson EV and the potential target amount of units to be sold. Finally, I want to know what features will differentiate this EV from other EVs. Is Dyson planning to focus on economical input (most battery efficient EV), price (lowest selling price compared to competitors), or offers new technology (advanced AI, self-driving features, VR- capabilities). Dyson needs to have a differentiation feature to separate itself from the customer to carve out a segment for them to operate. These three will things will give me a better understanding of the EV market to assess this market entry strategy for Dyson.",6,"I would want to know how long before 2020 has Oracle priced its cloud services cheaper than competitors.

Also, customers could have been exposed to this cheaper price throughout the pandemic which could be one reason why Oracle has seen increased revenue over the last few years. Also, I want to know the market growth data for could services for the past 10 years. With this data I want to see how much the market has grown and if any new competitors have entered the market. If the the market has grown I want to see how much market share Oracle has acquired or lost relative to competitors. In addition, I want to see the net income of Oracle over the past few years to see just how profitable they have been and how much they have increased year by year. Finally, I want to look at the financial data of the other main competitors in cloud services to see if any of the competitors had any recent events (financial loss, pricing, management changes) to gain more insight into their performance.",10,I think that property developers are creating and claiming value for these new high end developments because they are providing an experience that appeals to people who have this preference for luxury living. They are creating value because they are developing a product that is completely unique to the customer (they have an elevator that takes customers cars to their apartments instead of parking it in garages which allows the person to see the car as much as they like). That is an experience that aligns with people who buy luxury cars as these customers buy these vehicles with the idea that only a select amount of people have these luxury items and want to possess something that is unique. The property developers claim value from customers because they differentiate these properties with select features that appeal to the same type of people who has this taste for luxury living and who know will pay the higher price and capture more economic surplus because of it. This allows these developers to capture a very niche high paying market that offsets the high cost of building these properties while allowing them to make a profit too. ,4,TRUE,1,17,5,62

Distribution - can't use established distribution channels

Cost leadership - do the numbers add up

Differentiation - Can they successfully differentiate?

To assess the likelihood of success for Dyson's new EV market entry strategy, I would want to understand better its strategy around cost leadership, product differentiation, and distribution channels.

Normally, the barriers to entry for automobile manufacturing are relatively high, and the EV market is no exception. However, Dyson convincingly argues that its experience producing high-speed digital engines and batteries allows it to overcome these development barriers. This existing capacity could lend itself to a cost leadership and/or product differentiation strategy, the pursuit of which is essential in the increasingly competitive EV market. 

I would want to know if Dyson's existing capacity gives it a supply-side advantage, translating to lower COGS for its EVs, potentially locking in a cost advantage that could be passed on to customers to compete on price. It's also possible that Dyson's technological expertise could allow it to compete with a product differentiation strategy. I would need to see data indicating both that a Dyson EV could compete or exceed the performance of market leaders for their target customers and that this would translate to a higher willingness-to-pay.

Finally, distribution channels represent a notorious obstacle for car manufacturers, especially in the United States. Tesla differentiates itself by running its own dealerships while the other players compete for franchises. Dyson will be unable to use its established distribution channels for its household products to sell EVs, so will have to either spend the cash for a Tesla approach or dive into the crowded world of dealership franchises, with both options carrying considerable cost and risk. Understanding the price points and geographies of Dyson's target market could help illuminate this question, as competing against Tesla in the US is very different from competing against BYD in China.

Dyson may need to rely on more than its ""credentials"" to see success in the EV market by choosing its market entry approach to align with either a cost-leadership and/or product differentiation strategy.

 ",6,"It's one thing to hawk low prices to steal market share, it's another thing to be able to sustain that competitive play. To certify that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market I would want to look at three main pieces of information:

1) Cloud-associated costs broken down by percentages of revenue to compare to those of the market leaders.

2) Net profit margins to confirm whether the cost-leadership approach was actually translating into a competitive advantage.

3) I would want to understand if Oracle is engaged in a strategy purely to take market share away from market leaders or if it has identified an underserved customer segment. For example, nonprofit and public, municipal customers often lag behind the private sector and federal government in new technology adoption, and data storage is no exception. These customers must often balance tight budgets with competing priorities and data storage is emerging as a more and more important expense. Information related to marketing and distribution channels could indicate a differentiation from competitors.",4,"Porsche is very clearly pursuing a product differentiation strategy in an attempt to create value. Three main choices differentiate their offering from other real estate options: 1) No dedicated pedestrian entrance, while an offense to good urbanism everywhere, commits residents to the auto-centric Porsche lifestyle brand. 2) The building reflects Porsche design principles as ""sleek, souped-up [and] masculine."" And 3) the ""dezervator"" further centers residents' cars as vehicles of self-expression and conveyance of status. Each choice, from the location in downtown Miami, to the inaccessibility for pedestrians, to the ""dezervator"" which allows residents to show off their expensive cars, is intended to fuel feelings of prestige and eliteness that would increase customers' willingness to pay.

Furthermore, I would argue that Porsche is doing its best to claim the value that it is creating. At a construction cost of $480 million, even selling all of its 132 units at the lowest level of $4 million apiece would result in a return of $528 million and a profit of $48 million. The fact that some units are priced much higher, even to $32 million for one unit, indicates an intention to capture as much value as possible from its differentiation strategy.

Now, these choices merely reflect Porsche's strategy. To understand whether Porsche has actually been successful in creating and capturing value, I would need to know how many units they've actually been able to sell.",8,TRUE,1,19,3,70.5

Corteva is able to address the needs of the fearful customers as it developed a seed-and-chemical combination that is designed to combat hard-to-kill weeds while simultaneously eliminating the potential disadvantages of using its competitor's spray. Enlist E3 is built with a a herbicide known as 2,4-D choline. which gives growers a sense of freedom. As a result, growers have shifted to prefer Enlist E3 more, resulting in greater market share. ",3,"1. Challenges with path dependency associated with competitor's brand value: Dyson is a brand that is traditionally associated home appliances and beauty products like high-end vacuum cleaners, air wrap etc. Consumers may find it difficult to perceive Dyson as a EV manufacturer company. Hence, with the current existing competition from manufacturers like BYD and Tesla, Dyson may have a difficult time to create brand loyal for its EV customers. 

2. U.K.-based testing and research-and-development facilities: As indicated by the data provided, Mainland China dominates the worldwide electric vehicle market by 50%. This means that Mainland China is one of the biggest potential segment for the Dyson EV. Hence, testing and R&D should be focused more towards China to capture a greater percentage of the market. 

3. Lack of collaboration with other car makers: Dyson intends to leverage its existing resources for the development of its EV without taking into account that its current competitors are long established and many have structure based advantages (protected patents and market share dominance) and resource based advantages (design capability from top engineers and well established technology, processes and standardization for manufacturing). It may be important for Dyson to take these factors into account for its logistics and manufacturing. ",5,"We will need to perform a cost structure comparison of Oracle and its key competitors (AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud). In the analysis, we will need the cost drivers and the key cost structure components like logistics, salaries, rental, depreciation and amortization, maintenance, security cost, sales & marketing, general and administrative and other expenses). If the analysis indicates that Oracle is cost efficient compared to its competitors then we can assume that it has a cost leadership advantage. The comparison of Operating Margin may also be important to prove Oracle's cost leadership. 

Additionally, another important consideration will be the sustainability of the cost leadership. It is important to evaluate if it will be easy for the competitors to replicate, will the cost leadership naturally erode over time, and will Oracle be able to step with changes in customer demand, if needed. 

 ",5,"The developers of Porsche Design Tower have adopted the differentiation strategy for value creation. The development of the tower has increased the perceived benefit for its high end classy customers as it is associated with a sense of premium exclusiveness at a greater cost. This has increased the willingness to pay for the Porsche customers. As per the data, the cost to build the tower was $480 million, where 132 units run between $4 and $32 million. Porsche is creating as the uniqueness of the tower is increasing WTP, which in turn is increasing potential economic surplus. Additionally, in order to examine if Porsche is claiming value we will need to see if prices have been increased accordingly. The price may be high which is reducing consumer surplus and translating into higher revenue, thus claiming value. Furthermore, this may also have a network effect on Porsche's car line, potentially increase the WTP to increase for its cars as well.  

However, we will need to do a holistic analysis with a more in depth understanding of how much WTP has increased and the degree of price increase to claim value creation. ",12,TRUE,1,17,5,67

Largely aimed at less-flashy locales like suburban highway exits.

 

This allows Hilton to keep land costs low given they are away from big-city centers that generally have higher traffic.

The overall footprint of the property is smaller when compared to other comparable Hilton Brands and competitors.

As a result, Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range. 

Therefore, Hilton is able to maximize price/sq ft. with this approach.

The design allows for some part of the construction process to be done offsite.

 

This helps reduce the development costs and time to develop given activities can take place simultaneously and in areas with lower labor costs.

As expected based on the lower room price, in room coffee makers have been banished. 

 

Rather than carpet, floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped.

This helps reduce the time to clean and associated costs. 

 

Not stated in the case, based on experience, my assumption is that Tru hotels also do not provide guest services such as room service or extensive in room entertainment.

Therefore, reducing associated costs. 

The desks have also been removed from the rooms to reduce furnishing costs and cleaning costs.

Given the rooms do not have desks or coffee machines, Tru hotels have a lobby that is more than 80% larger than Hilton’s typical Hampton Inn location.

The lobby has self-serve market area where guests can get drinks like Craft beer and food. In addition, it boasts recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work.

This approach allows Hilton to reduce the overall variable costs for each room.

High Barriers to Entry - can Dyson overcome the massive manufacturing and distribution hurdles to ensure long-term profitability?

* Dyson is making significant up front costs (£2 billion to the project, including £200 million on U.K.-based testing and research-and-development facilities) without clear indication of ROI

* Bringing an EV to market requires overcoming extensive regulatory hurdles that differ from market to market (e.g. China, the largest EV market, may have regulation deterring outside competitors from entering the market with the local brands)

* The existing players such as Tesla, Volkswagen Group, SAIC, BYD, etc. have strong relationships with suppliers and distribution channels globally that take years and significant investment to establish

Competitive Rivalry - can Dyson differentiate itself against the major players in this highly-competitive market?

* Dyson has an incredible reputation fusing innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances, however, consumers do not view them anywhere close to being automobile manufacturers

* The existing players such as Tesla, Volkswagen Group, SAIC, BYD, etc. have been in the market for over a decade 

* The market share is controlled by a few big players (e.g. Tesla counts for 40% of all EVs sold in the U.S. between 2010 and 2019; BYD and Tesla account for 32.3% of Global EV sales in Q3 2022)

Capability and Demand Gaps - does Dyson have the engineering and support capabilities to even produce an EV?

* Dyson has an incredible reputation fusing innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances, however, they have no experience developing full vehicles

* Given Dyson would likely enter the U.K and Europe markets first, the market is relatively small for TVs in those regions (e.g. looking at 2021 EV unit sales, 327K in UK and 828K in Europe compared to 3.5M units in China and 631K in US)

* Dyson already makes components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries, and it needs to invest heavily in talent and resources to support manufacturing, design, and marketing activities throughout the overall value chain

*",7,"To certify that Oracle's Cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market we need to prove the following:

*  Oracle's product performance against competitors's products (i.e. perceived value relative to product and service feature/performance)

* Oracle's customer mix against competitors's customer mix (i.e. concentration of customers in enterprise vs SMBs resulting in varied WTPs)

* Industry market share metrics and changes over time (i.e. has Oracle gained or lost market share over time?)

* Industry revenue metrics and changes over time (i.e. how does Oracle's quantity sold and prices compare to its competitors and the market overall?) 

* Industry profitability metrics (Gross Margin, COGS, SG&A Expenses, R&D Expenses, Net Profit Margin, CAGR) and changes over time (i.e. how does Oracle's profitability metrics compare to its competitors and the market overall?) ",10,"Based on the limited information provided, I hypothesize that Porsche understands its target market and is employing an innovative strategy (similar to its competitors) to create and capture value from the market:

Choose the value

* The market for name-brand luxury condominium units is projected to grow 12% each year between now and 2026

* The top 1% in Miami and equivalent markets have a need for affluence and showcase of wealth

* Luxury brands are moving to become lifestyle brands and this move by Porsche and others is the epitomy

Provide the value

* It was a natural continuation to transfer Porsche's unique automobile design principles to the world of real estate

* In Miami Beach, the Porsche Design Tower has the same sleek, souped-up masculine energy of the cars

Communicate the value

* I would argue that the value is communicated 24/7 to the owners and aspiring owners given the unique design of the building and the key feature - That elevator — which deposits cars behind a glass wall in front of each unit — is “a highlight” of the building 

* The building alone is a premier marketing tool for Porsche;  the building design and tenants driving their Porsches in the vicinity are active marketing tools for the company

Overall, with this strategy, Porsche is literally and metaphorically capturing its customers by getting them into Porsche clothing, driving in Porsche cars, to go sleep in their Porsche condos.

However, they should be aware that home appliance and electric cars are totally different. Therefore,  question ""Dyson's capability and resources fit the EV market?"" should be asked.

Secondly, structure of the home appliance industry and EV industry is very different. Unlike home appliance industry, startup costs will be enormous for EV. In addition, automobile companies usually outsource a lot of manufacturing parts they are not confident with. Lacking partnership, it will be hard for them to find suppliers that will provide high quality product at acceptable price. Therefore, they should consider ""Will Dyson be profitable in this whold different structure of the market?""

Lastly, ""Will Dyson have competitive advantage throughout that market"" should be answered. When they make a car with great design, there is a possibility that competitors might imitate the design. Additonally, they should also consider if they can sustain the attractive price for customers.",8,"To assess Oracle's competitive advantage in the market, additional information should be given.

1. Margin

Even with great sales growth, if they implemented low price strategy there might be possibility that they might have very small margin, or they might even go negative margin. Company with low or negative margin will not be able to sustain their selling price not to go bankrupt. 

2. Growth rate

Oracle seems like they achieved a significant growth rate of 66%. However, without knowing whole market's growth rate and competitor's growth rate, their competitive advantage cannot be fully assessed. If the whole market growth rate and competitor's growth rate are much higher than 66%, Oracle seems to be lacking competitive advantage.

Without knowing consumer's exact WTP in Miami beach, it is hard to tell. However, assuming that there are many rich retirees that are living in Miami Beach, with the luxurious building, there should be very high WTP. We can assume that they have created the value.

Value capture

With consumer's high WTP, they sold the unit very expensively. Assuming average unit price is $18M[($4M+$32M)/2], total sales will be $3676M. Even though they spent $480M to build, they captured the value by selling it in premium price. Even with the calculation assuming all the units are $4M, total sales would be $528M.

* Where does Dyson want to bring its product to market?

* There are significant barriers to entry based on which market Dyson's product is debuted in -  Dyson will have a hard time breaking into the resource supply and distribution channels occupied by industry incumbents (Tesla in the US, BYD in China for instance).

* Certain markets might have higher switching costs - for instance, in the US - which is dominated by Tesla ...Tesla owners are likely very loyal customers based on previous experience... In the UK and EU, where Dyson likely has a stronger brand image and reputation, customers might be more willing to switch over the to new product.

* Does Dyson have the capital/Can Dyson raise the capital necessary to start-up factories to produce its product?

* 2 billion pounds might not be enough for a product that might take a loss for several years after launch....

* Where does Dyson want to produce its product?

* If it is anywhere other than the country it seeks to bring the car to market, Dyson faces a high barrier to entry - establishing complex supply chains.

* Outsourcing production to another country might exclude bringing Dyson's best talent available to create the product -> losing a key strategic resource that Dyson has over any car maker.

* What offering does Dyson want to make and at what price?

* A more premium/high performance or luxury offering would be more consistent with Dyson's brand image and innovative engineering... 

* The price that Dyson charges would define its competitors (is it competing with the lower end Leaf or BYD? or the higher end Teslas/Rivians/Polestars?)

* The price that Dyson charges would constrain its potential customers - lower prices mean more potential customers, but could also create more value to the customer and help the new company steal market share from incumbents

 

 ",7,"True, Oracle's revenues are growing and Oracle is cheaper in price than the competition; however, is it merely creating more value for the customer through consumer surplus with lower prices or is Oracle claiming more value by also reducing costs? At this point we know nothing about Oracle's costs or how they are benchmarked to the competition.

To see a cost leadership competitive advantage I would like to see the following information:

* Profit Margin for Oracle and the Industry Average for the past 5 years

* Shows whether Oracle is claiming more value (is it reducing costs more than it has lowered prices below the competition.

* Net Income, % change in sales, and % change in market share for Oracle and the Industry Average for the past 5 years

* Maybe Oracle HAS created more value for the customer by reducing price more than costs and it competing for market share and volume in the cloud service industry.

* Cost structure analysis as a % of total sales for Oracle and Industry Average for the past five years

* Is Oracle doing something unique across its cost structure - lowest cost of sales? minimizing sales and advertising expenses?",5,"Porsche Lifestyle Group is attempting to use a differentiation strategy in their real estate asset of Porsche Tower. Elements of differentiation strategy -> build value for customer:

* Brand Name: Porsche - association with high-end automobile builds value

* High sqft. in prime real-estate location: At 60 stories with 132 units, there is an average of 2.2 units per floor in Miami Beach.

* High price: Exclusive to high-income individuals with prices from $4 million to $32 million.

* They have a unique offering of the Dezervator - a car elevator that brings your automobile right to your apartment, no matter which floor it is on.

* Exclusive access: no designated walk-in entrance

There is no way without adequate industry reference points to tell whether Porsche Lifestyle Group is creating/claiming value or both. Without a reference point, the numbers do not mean anything. What we do know is that Porsche has the potential to make a large profit:

* Cost Analysis: $480 million investment

* 10% on the Deservator: $48 million

* 90% on remaining infrastructure: $432 million -> about $3.27 million/unit (assuming costs spread equally)

* Price Analysis: Exclusive to high-income individuals with prices from $4 million to $32 million.

* Average price: $18 million/unit (assuming equal weighting of unit prices)

* Total potential revenue: $18 million/unit x 132 units = $2.376 billion

* For soybean farmers

* Who are dissatisfied with Monsanto's products due to regulations and potential for damage to neighboring crops

* At a similar price

Assumption: The products are similarly prices. The passage does not talk about price. Please note it is entirely possible that Corteva's product demands a price premium as it is a superior product. 

Explanation: The soybean seed and chemical market is essentially a duopoly with Monsanto and Corteva accounting for ~70% of the market share. As per the passage, there is a high level of competition in the market. Defects/Shortcomings in Monsanto's latest product has enabled Corteva to swoop in and gain significant market share by offering a superior product and positioning it directly against its main competitor.",7.5,"Areas of Concern:

1) Steep learning curve & High fixed costs: The EV market is characterized by significant start-up costs to enter the market (eg: to set up factories) which raises barriers to entry. This also implies that the minimum efficient scale in the market is higher. Additionally, EV production likely requires a high degree on specialization which needs to be built over time. While Dyson does possess know-how regarding a few components required in EV production, it does not have any expertise in rest of the components required. This again raises barriers to entry.       

2) High competition: As witnessed by the exhibits, the EV market is characterized by high competition despite the growing nature of the market. Tesla lost its market leadership in 2021 (estimated market share in 2021: 13.6%) to BYD by 3Q22. Additionally, the largest and fastest growing market, Mainland China, has 100+ competitors and nearly 300 models. This indicates a highly competitive market which is difficult to enter. Additionally, this might also indicate that multiple product launches are required to achieve minimum efficient scale for a few (needs to verified as parts of next steps through research) further raising entry barriers. 

3) Access to resources/subsidies: As of 3Q22, three of the top-5 players in the world are Chinese (accounting for 27.6% of the global market share). This is likely due to structural and resource advantages possessed by China. China is the market leader in production of batteries, which are a key resource for EV's. Additionally, the Chinese government provides subsidies to its players, enabling them to compete on price. Dyson does not benefit from any of these advantages and these advantages are hard to replicate. Finally, Dyson likely also lags behind in terms of Automobile engineers talent than the incumbent players. 

 ",9,"We need to assess the sustainability of Oracle's cost leadership. This is dependent on rarity and ease of replication.

* First we need to assess if Oracle's business model is generating profits, or if it is taking losses in order to gain market share. if its taking loses, the company does not have a genuine cost leadership advantage. However, if it is a profitable business model then we can continue our research.  

* We would need a peer comparison of cost per unit along the company's value chain including all activities required for sale (if data for all activities is unavailable we should try to estimate the data for the largest components of cost structure). 

* Once we have an available peer comparison in per unit terms, we can identify where among the value chain Oracle is generating cost advantages. 

* Next steps would include diving deeper into the identified cost advantages to see if these can be easily replicated by the competition, if these advantages are not rare and hard to replicate we can expect the competition to also drive their costs down and erode Oracles advantage. (Please note: since we do not have initial data of cost per unit along the company's activities, it hard to provide an example of what would make the cost advantages replicable or not). 

* Sustainability of cost advantage would also depend on size of margins and cyclicality of the industry. If the margins are thin and the industry is cyclical, then the business model could be unsustainable during a downturn (although as per my limited knowledge of the cloud computing business, i would hypothesize that its not a cyclical market).    ",5,"The generic strategy used by Porsche in the luxury condominium market is differentiation (same as its strategy in the car market!). This is evidenced by the focus on the sleek design of the building, an aggressive and noticeable arch, an airy lobby and most importantly, the crown jewel, 'The Dezervator'. 

The company has managed to create value and increase their customers WTP through these features. This is evidenced by the prices charged per unit, which range from $4mm to $32mm. The price range also shows that Porsche is also claiming the value it has created.

Notably, even if Porsche charged the lowest listed price for all units ($4mm) it would generate profits of $48mm($4mm*132 - $480mm). While the exact expected profit cannot be calculated it is a reasonable assumption that the profit is significantly higher than $48mm, given the price ranges to $32mm. ",8,TRUE,1,20,2,82.5

- Focused on convenient locations near highway exits. This is true of most of Tru's competitors as well, but they can make decisions on the exterior to raise their appeal.

-20% smaller than competitors, which allows Tru to raise effective price per square foot while keeping the per night price flat against competition. 

 

- Controlling for building site size, Tru can have more capacity than their competitors. We would need to see their average building size compared to competitors to see if they are exploiting this potential advantage. 

- The hotels are optimized for cleaning with vinyl floors, no desk, and no coffee maker. This focus on reducing cleaning time saves on labor costs and turnaround time for the room, lowering the cost structure and freeing up capacity. 

Lobby 

- Their lobby is 80% larger than the average Hampton Inn. While the two decisions above are largely cost drivers, the lobby is aimed at raising WTP by improving the customer's initial impression of the hotel. A memorable lobby can also contribute to an increase in repeat purchases

- Devotes more space to shared amenities that can increase economic surplus by including self serve snack and drink options, an activity area, and work pods. This is another low touch method to increase WTP. While Tru will have to ensure that these areas are maintained by the cleaning staff, none of these amenities require the hotel to hire additional dedicated staff.

* Who are dissatisfied with the liability and potential drift of dicamba

* Corteva's Enlist E3 offering lowers the risk of damage to nearby crops and farms

* At a similar price. 

* Key Color Points/clarifiers

* The market is corn and soybean farmers based on my understanding of the statement, but we would want to verify this using additional information on the pesticide market. The customer base could actually be larger than what I have in my statement. 

* Depending on how you read it, liability can refer to the breach of government regulation as well as any civil liability resulting from damage to neighboring farms.

* It was unclear from the reading whether the crop damage from dicamba primarily referred to inter farm or intra farm damage. Either way, this would present an externality, but the total costs of forgoing profit on your own farm versus settling a dispute with a neighboring farm could be very different. 

* The snippet provided does not specify the price that Corteva has set. Given that it was not mentioned to be noticeably cheaper or more expensive, I assumed that Corteva's price is in the same ballpark as its competitors, but I would like to verify this with more information. ",7.5,"* Manufacturing and Procurement

* Dyson has not made any products that are similar in scale to a vehicle. How does Dyson plan to manufacture vehicles? I am not convinced that manufacturing expertise for hair dryers and vacuums lowers the learning curve for the mass production of vehicles. 

* What is their strategy for acquiring key inputs like batteries? The inputs for this electric car are going to be more costly, and I would be surprised if their supplier base had car parts readily available. If I am wrong though, then Dyson could have relationships with suppliers that can provide off shelf parts to aid the design of the car. 

* How much are they willing to invest in developing production capabilities? $2.6 BB seems low in this market. If they are serious about gaining share, then they would have to raise this number.

* Logistics

* How will they manage outbound logistics from manufacturing sites to dealerships? While Dyson can currently ship their products globally with relative ease. They likely have the ability to utilize air freight in a pinch due to the size of their products. Shipping costs are likely low since they can fit a large number of dryers, fans, or vacuums in a container. Shipping cars will be much less flexible due to the size constraints of shipping. 

* How will they manage their portfolio of manufacturing facilities? Will they outsource most of their componentry or dedicate factories to making specific parts of the car? We have seen EV companies develop factories to produce batteries and sub assembled systems of parts for different vehicles. Will Dyson follow suit or adopt a different strategy? How will that affect the time that it takes for a car to get assembled and shipped to the dealership?

* Service

* Due to their size, most of Dyson's products can be shipped to the manufacturer if they need to be fixed under warranty.

* While their current products demand a price premium, their portfolio is much cheaper than the average EV. There is an undeniable difference between consumer's willingness to throw out a vacuum and their willingness to abandon a car that needs a replacement part. Dyson will need a strategy to deal with much more continued maintenance on EVs than they have on their other products. 

* Dyson lacks the expertise required to develop and maintain a large portfolio of replacement parts. To best make this point, I would want to see data delineating the amount of products under warranty that they repair versus the amount of warranty claims that result in them replacing the product entirely. If Dyson sells their own refurbished products, we could gain some confidence in their ability to develop and track replacement parts. ",3,"We would need data on their entire cost structure. We only have data in the text above on their revenue and pricing. 

Anyone can lower their price and lose money; just look at the streaming charts in this exam. To convince me that they have a cost advantage, I would need to see that they have a lower cost structure than their competitors. This means that I would like to see the following metrics:

* COGS (% of Revenue)

* SG&A (% of Revenue)

* CAPEX and Depreciation (Values, % Revenue, Average Usable Life of PP&E)

* Net Income (Value and % of Revenue)

* Total Assets.

These metrics would allow me to determine the actual cost structure for Oracle and its competitors. I could compute the operating and net margins with this information to verify the numbers that I would see from COGS and SG&A. I would also be interested in asset turn and ROA to see if Oracle is more efficient than competitors with their lower cost structure. 

The CAPEX and Depreciation requests above are also critical for this industry. Cloud computing relies on the purchase and maintenance of large server farms that are becoming increasingly specialized to support new technologies like generative AI. To determine that Oracle has a long term cost advantage, I will need to see that they are not depressing their CAPEX spend to generate short term gains that will be erased when their current machinery fully depreciates. EBIT comparisons and EBIT multiples could also be useful to understand Oracle's current strategy when it comes to CAPEX. ",5,"This is a differentiation strategy. These developers are partnering with prestigious consumer brands to increase the WTP for their condominiums. These buildings have a high development cost, and they seek to attract a premium price with their additional features.  

This is primarily a strategy to claim value. While the Porsche example does indicate the relative cost of the car elevator, this feature's functional value is minimal at best. Outside of that feature and the fluffy statements on shared design elements, this strategy seeks to raise price and associated profit by slapping a new sign on the front door of the building and calling it a value add. 

A counterargument here could make the case that the building adds psychological value for the customer by generating a sense of esteem. We have seen in class that brands do carry some inherent value, but I am not convinced that this strategy adds commensurate value to offset its price increases. ",8,TRUE,1,19,3,74.5

(I am operating under the assumption that Corteva's product is priced reasonable/competitively when compared to Monsanto's product whose success has been hindered by the evaporation issue.)

Bottom line is that Corteva is offering a similar product to Monsanto that provides customers similar value without the concerning Dicamba evaporation/neighboring crop damage side-effect which is present with the Monsanto offering.",6.5,"Dyson's new EV market strategy is very concerning to me because it seems that Dyson is attempting to grow in such a way that will likely damage their current strategic positioning which is strong the every day appliance market.  While growth is often tempting for a firm, growth can also be dangerous as growth efforts can ""blur uniqueness, create compromises, reduce fit, and undermine competitive advantage"".  It seems that Dyson's decision to drastically expand into the EV market is fraught with many of these dangers.  Dyson's current strategic positioning is strong as they are effectively focused on serving a ""few needs of many customers"" by focusing on vacuum cleaners and other every day appliances.  If Dyson moves into the EV space and especially if they make this move without an experienced partner they risk diluting the value of their current brand, as well as risk of large financial losses due to their needing to make large capital expenditures to enter the EV market which they are not experienced in and where their ROI is unknown.  While Dyson believes that their experience and success fusing innovating engineering and design will carry over to the EV space, this is a potentially fraught assumption as their having ""fit"" among company activities is not guaranteed to carry over into the EV space where they have no prior experience.  A key component pf strategy is making the appropriate ""trade-offs"" which Dyson may run afoul of if they enter the EV space without conducting sufficient due diligence on the market and their own companies activities.  Dyson should also consider the fact that players like Tesla have incumbency advantages, existing distribution channels, and possibly supply side economies of scale, all of which will complicate Dysons successful entry into the EV market.",5,"In order to certify that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market I would need:

--  Oracle's percentage of market share in the cloud market:  We know that they have 2% of total cloud revenue but we do not know what portion of the cloud services market this 2% of revenue actually represents.  Is Oracle gaining market share from their competition?  This would help us know whether there is a genuine cost leadership advantage.

--  Do other firms offer even less expensive cloud services?  Competing on price alone is potentially dangerous as the firm doing this can only do this for as long as another player does not lower its prices resulting in a potential price war.  We would need to know how differentiated Oracle's cloud services are to better understand whether other competitors could easily undercut their prices.

--  We would need to know the total costs (SG&A +COGS) associated with Oracle's cloud services along with their prices for services and their current number of customers in order to identify whether they have healthy/sustainable  revenues and profit margins.  

--  We would need to know more about Amazon, Google, Azure, and other competitors cloud offerings in order to determine if they have a strong and sustainable competitive advantage based on a differentiation strategy.  This is important because we want to know if they are offering consumers a differentiated product that provides a level of value for which customers have a higher WTP.  We would also want to ideally know more about our competitors total costs, if their revenue is greater but their costs are also much higher or lower this will provide us with valuable insight.",8,"The property developers are relying on a differentiation strategy in order to achieve competitive advantage in the name-brand luxury condominium market.  By creating such a unique offering in this space, the developer has created value for wealthy customers who are also Porsche enthusiasts.  By pricing the 132 units between $4 and $32 million the developer will be able to claim value as long as home sales exceed the development cost of $480 million.  Based on some quick math, if all 132 units sold for the lowest price of $4 million than the revenue would be $528 million allowing the developer to claim value.  Since many of the units are likely priced above $4 million it seems reasonable to assume that as long as the developer does not face significant issues with finding buyers, they will be able to recoup cost and claim value from this project.  Given the capital intensive nature of this project, and brand loyalty of Porsche enthusiasts, it is also unlikely that a competitor can build a similar building that would appeal to the ultra wealthy Porsche enthusiast customer base which is clearly the target customer for this project.  Given these assumptions, I believe the developer is both creating and claiming value.",9,TRUE,1,18,4,75.5

Activities

Specific Choices

Support in Competitive Positioning

Choice 1

Design

More rooms across a smaller amount of space means better utilization of space.

Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room.

The rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. Floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped, and in-room desks and coffee makers have been banished.

They have a better asset turnover rate reducing their cost structure.

By making the rooms smaller, they are able to add more rooms in the same place. They are understanding what the customer is willing to pay for. Increasing the room space will lead to fewer rooms and less revenue. Customers are looking for a place to live for the night or in case of emergencies. In such cases, the space of the room is not the major concerns. Hence by decreasing the room space, they have more space to accommodate customers and increase their revenue.

Choice 2

Site Selection

Location is away from big city centers. This helps to reduce the cost of buying/renting land for the hotels and low fixed cost.

This decreases the fixed cost and helps them price at a lower rate. If the fixed cost is high, they will have to increase the prices in the longer run to make up for the high fixed cost. 

Being away from the big city center reduced the fixed cost, helping them in charging low rates.

Choice 3

Guest Serivces

Lobbies are 80% larger than Hilton’s typical Hampton Inn location and are brightly colored with a self-serve market area where guests can get drinks like Craft beer and food, and also boasts recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work.

 

This is the first thing that a customer sees while entering the hotel. Having good first impressions help in making customers feel that their expenditure is worth the price, attracting more customers and covering for the less room space.

 

Choice 4

Construction

Some part of the construction process to be done offsite

This allows the construction to be completed earlier and more time to gain revenue. This also decreases the price by reducing the complexity of the design, material used, and the fixed cost associated with the construction cost of the hotel.",9,"Corteva has used the ""I have freedom to spray"" to gain market share. 

Dicamba has the ability to damage the surrounding crops, thus inducing fear in the minds of the farmers. Fear creates resistance in the minds of the customers for the existing products and need arises for new products. Corteva has used this fear to launch a product that does not harm the surrounding crops and tapped the market of farmers that had this fear and shifted them from Monsanto to Corteva.

The addition of time limits also puts farmers at a disadvantage, and they cannot use the product as per their convenience.  This creates hurdles in the use of Monsanto products and farmers were looking for an alternative. This is where Corteva came into the market and meet the needs of the customers. ",3,"The three most critical areas of concern I would have are:

Rivalry Among the Existing Competitors:

There are already big players in the market with deep pockets and years of car-making know-how. This will make the entry into the market very difficult. It will be very hard for them to come up a differentiated product, especially with no to very little experience in auto motive industry. This is huge investment, having very high fixed to variable cost ratio and high barriers to exit. All of these make the rivalry among the existing competitors a very strong area of concern for them.

Threat of Substitutes

There is always a risk of having fuel driven vehicles as substitutes. EVs sales number is growing but they need to see if there will be enough demand for EVs for them to start and sustain their business successfully in future. They need to have differentiated product or price to make sure people are buying them. There will be medium to high switching cost in the minds of customers which Dyson would have to overcome to make them successful. All of these make the threat of substitutes a great concern for Dyson.

Bargaining Power of Buyers

There is very limited demand of EVs in the market and the existing competition is enough to meet those demands. There is very little to no difference between the existing EVs. Hence this gives buyers the power to bargain for the prices and will be a serious concern for Dyson. They will have to set prices that the customers think Dyson EVs is worth enough when compared to other companies. The buyers are limited, and the product is not highly differentiated, hence the buyers have a lot of bargaining power and a concern for Dyson leadership.  ",4,"The unit cost analysis needs to be done and compared to be 100% sure thar oracle has the cost leadership competitive advantage. We need to prove that COGS% and SG&A% to revenue is also the lowest for the oracle, If the COGS and SG&A are similar to other companies when compared with revenue, they do not have cost leadership competitive advantage,

If the unit cost is same then oracle does not have this advantage but if is lower than the other companies, then we can say that is has the cost leadership competitive advantage,

 ",5,"They are creating more value as compared to claiming the value.

The unique Dezervator is a unique addition that is very difficult to re-applicate because of the complex design and high investment cost. Car lovers like to keep on watching their luxury cars. It is a sense of achievement for many. By having Dezervator, Porsche has been able to meet the needs of their customers, allowing them to create a value for themselves.

The looks of the car from the second image shows that it has not just the ability to take you with you to your room that matters, it is also how your car will look to you from your room and Porsche has done an excellent job in doing both the things. The lights at the bottom of the Dezervator are increasing the elegance of the car, creating an urge in the person living in that room to look at the car again and again. Thus, they are increasing the beauty of the car at the same time. This is creating value for them and a unique experience for anyone else.",4,TRUE,1,15,7,53

Corteva offers a soybean-and-spray combination, Enlist E3, that does not have the potential damages caused by drift and is priced similar to the competition. 

Corteva was able to gain market share by creating value that appealed to the customers. Enlist E3 was able to differentiate themselves from Dicamba by making a product that gave farmers a valuable advantage. Farmers were no longer worried about certain regulations for when to spray and when not to. Also, farmers did not have to worry about  other crops being ruined in the process of drift. ",7.5,"1. Can Dyson implement a resource based competitive advantage to gain some market share in the EV market?

Dyson prides itself in innovative engineering and design but will this be enough to produce EVs that can compete with Tesla. Dyson would need to differentiate themselves with an EV that is not seen in the market to compete with the other players. Tesla's structure based competitive advantage alone dominates the industry. Tesla has obtained licenses to have their chargers all over the United States which creates a competitive advantage. Also, Tesla has given permission to other EVs to use their chargers which creates a network for Telsa that cannot be matched by other EV manufactures.

2. Will Dyson be able to create any source of cost advantage with the production of EVs?

Dyson already makes components that are necessary for EV manufacturing however will their initial investment be able to get the project off the ground and running. Dyson is competing with players like Tesla who has achieved a cost advantage by streamlining the manufacturing process by utilizing the same batteries in all models of cars and charging customers less compared to competitors. In order to even compete with cost, Dyson would need to outfit their factories with all new production lines and machines creating more capital expenditures as it embarks on this process.

3. What are customer's switching costs?

The threat of substitutes in this market are extravagant with numerous brands out there to choose from. Will Dyson be able to differentiate themselves enough that it would be less likely for available substitutes to be viewed as ""perfect"" substitutes? Most brands do not have loyal customers but Tesla could be the only one that may have some brand loyalty because of the ease of finding chargers for their cars. 

 ",5,"In order to prove Oracle has a cost competitive advantage you would need to prove that Oracle is performing activities differently and are offering customizable solutions. To analyze their cost advantage you would examine a simple unit of computing service, identify activities performed to produce the computing service, focus on differences in competitors strategic policy (tradeoffs), use company cost structure and industry average expenses to make an assumption, and compare unit costs between competitors (marginal and average costs). The specific measures you would be concerned with are COGS %, SG&A %, COGS and SG&A growth rate, cost, price, WTP, and economic surplus. ",5,"The Porsche Tower is creating and claiming more value.

Tru will be in an easy to access location of the highway and not in a nice urban area. 

Building offsite to cut costs adds value to their product sourcing as they are being more cost effective by doing so. 

The creation of a large lobby and smaller rooms creates a marginal difference that adds value to firm operations by making cleaning easier.

The open lobby's with places to work create value for the traveling worker that is looking for a discounted stay.

The value of the land will be lower in these areas that'll cut costs in production.

With less appliances and easier and faster cleaning of smaller rooms there is added value to firm operations. 

Creating recreational spaces at a hotel that has an affordable price could bring in groups of workers or attract customers that are in a town for a group event.

Adding food and beer to the stay creates a competitive advantage for in differentiating with a low cost.",7,"If you are a soybean farmer that sprays their crops, who is dissatisfied with Monsantos product, our offerings provide a pesticide that doesn't travel at a competitive price. ",7,"I see Dyson's first and largest issue to be the threat of new entries being low. The market is highly saturated with large players that are established and have deep pockets. Although Dysons initial investment of 2.6 billion into their production, and their claimed speed to market, it doesnt seem like it would be enough to compete with companies producing millions of units in sales. Their next most critical area is Rivalry among competitors. Dyson says its relying on its name brand credentials to compete, but I think they need to take into account the established market already carries a high quality name brand value in a market Dyson has never entered before. The advantage that Dyson claims to have could be lost on investors considering the advantage of just having an electric car doesnt mean there is advantage in the market against people that are already selling that product. Or in other words there is no difference in performance just because Dyson has a good name in appliances. Third I think my concern would come from supplier power. Although Dyson says it has quality engineers and a good reputation in its own market its still essentially making the same product as the other companies thus not adding value to its product. If the suppliers are selling at a set price to Dyson's competitors, and they are not sold on Dyson's potential success they could get washed out of the market. ",5,"Oracles strategy activity is differentiating itself from its competitors through a cost leadership strategy. Its affordable pricing is a start, but we would also need to know if their producing this product from a source that allows them to have better profit margins, which is simpler to achieve within cloud-based computing because Oracle could likely create a better value chain not having to outsource for programmers in this case that would make their specific cloud system. Market data that could be used is how much market share is composed of cloud infrastructure users that are looking for a value based platform and then what the barrier to entry is into a market such as cloud infrastructure. The performance of other competitive firms could tell us that there is a wedge Oracle could drive between customers willingness to pay and supplier opportunity. If a customers willingness to pay is lower and Oracle has a supplier lowering costs they could exploit a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market. ",9,"I believe that Porsche is using both the creation and claiming of value in their tower.

Corteva has been able to join the Soybean seed and herbicide market in the US as a substitute product to the heavily regulated product that Monsanto sells. Additionally Corteva offers a differentiated product as their herbicide uses 4-D choline instead of Dicamba. The use of 4-D choline does not cause drift and reduces the risk of farmers facing liabilities.  Corteva with this offering is creating value and increasing consumers willingness to pay for a spray that kills weed and protects them from liabilities, enabling them to gain market share. ",6.5,"1. What is the differentiated factor that Dyson provides? According to the news article a lot of competitors are in the market or just joining the market. Therefore there is high competitive rivalry with many offering similar products. How would Dysons product compete and differentiate themselves from automakers who have been in the industry longer and built the brand loyalty. 

2. How many products can be created in house versus specialty pieces that may need to be outsourced to suppliers? While the artlicle states that the company already makes some components used in cars like batteries and high-speed motors, will other pieces require outsourcing that can significantly increase cost. If the pieces that are outsourced are more unique this could be a threat to industry profit as the suppliers will have the power to charge a premium.

3. Is there threat for substitutes in the industry? With technology constantly changing and innovating is there a new product launch that would offer a better alternative for consumers. For example if traditional car makers create a more gas efficient vehicle this could potentially hinder the EV market. It would be good to research more on emerging technologies in the auto indrustry to make sure this industry will not be impacted by other auto innovations. ",4,"To certify that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine competitive advantage I would first need to know/calculate gross margins, operating margins, key cost structure components.

According to the article, 30% of nightly room demand is for rooms priced under $83. This suggests that these customers are likely transitory, i.e., traveling along the interstate. By strategically locating Tru hotels along interstates, Hilton is better positioned to serve this large customer base. Further, by being located away from large city centers, Hilton is able to purchase and occupy land at a less expensive rate. This strategic choice lends itself to a more resource-based strategy and therefore can be difficult to replicate.

Designing the rooms 20% smaller while eliminating features of the room that contribute to longer cleaning times e.g., coffee makers, carpet, Hilton can reduce costs around cleaning time and ensure faster turnaround for customers seeking to reserve a room without a reservation.

Hilton's choice to configure the buildings such that portions of the construction can take place off site and be assembled later on allow for them to save costs on materials and labor. Further, by increasing the number of rooms in each location, Hilton can attempt to achieve their desired returns through volume of sales.

By increasing the size of the lobby relative to their other hotels, Hilton is seeking to encourage the customer to spend less time in their room and more time in the in the common areas where they can work, drink alcoholic beverages, and socialize. In so doing, Hilton, through the sales of food and beverages, attempt to contribute to their returns. ",8,"For soybean farmers across the United States

 ",6,"EV Market Structure Concerns:

1) Supplier Power: There is a concentrated number of suppliers, given the rarity of the materials necessary for producing EV batteries, in this market. This control over such a crucial raw material creates a significant barrier of entry for Dyson in the form these suppliers being capable of extracting high concessions from Dyson in exchange for the battery inputs.

Dyson's Resources/Capabilities:

2) Dyson's intangible resource is surely its brand. However, its brand name is coupled tightly with home appliances, such as vacuum cleaners and hair dryers. I am skeptical that Dyson could successfully leverage this resource to compete, successfully, in a market that is dominated by brands whose core business is EVs.

3) My final concern is about Dyson's tangible resources. That is, the necessary factories/plants required to produce EVs at a rate that would allow them to compete. While Dyson surely has production plants, they are configured for small home appliances. The cost to reconfigure, or purchase a new plant, to produce EVs would require a substantial investment that, given the current competitive landscape, would take a significant amount of time to recover.",4,"I would need to see a breakdown of their costs related to their infrastructure offering. To claim a cost-based advantage it is not enough to boast a cheaper price than your competitors. Oracle, to make such a claim, would need to be able to produce this product cheaper relative to their competitors and sell it for cheaper. 

I would then like to understand where the value from this lower price is being passed -- the firm or the customer. If Oracle is 61% cheaper than AWS and they produce the product for 65% cheaper than AWS, 4% of that value is being passed to the firm.

Finally, an analysis of Oracle's profit margin growth over time can indicate whether there is a true cost advantage present. ",5,"Porche is capturing the value from the Dezervator Tower.

The strategic choices of Tru/Hilton are one that support a cost leadership strategy with a mix of differention as well. The hotel chain is focusing on economies of scaling production to capture the market, process efficiency, low pricing tactics (different from the Hilton brand we generally know), and tight cost control. Achieving tight cost control will be difficult as mentioned by competitors. If Hilton can successfully execute this strategy, they will achieve a positive and significant market share shift by taking a cost leadership approach with the element of differentiation solely because of their strong brand. ",8,"For farmers concerned with weed killer wind drift and who are dissatisfied with application limitations during season. Our offering provides an herbicide that is safe and unaffected wind drift during the summer heat at a lower price than our competitors.

Corteva focused on creating a product to be competitive with Monsato in the understanding that the previous iteration was negatively affecting farmers and created cautious use. By developing a product that is differentiated from its competitor in a significant way, Corteva has been able to gain market share of the farmers concerned with resistance and crop damage secondary to wind drift. Their business activity was 'differentiation' with an R&D focus, high quality source, and customer relations (farmers likely to use because it doesn't damage other crops). ",7,"How is Dyson planning to differentiate itself from a highyl competitive market with strong brands across the board?

Has Dyson identified its competitive advatange in the EV market besides having experience creating powerful household appliance motors?

What will be Dyson's marketing strategy to convince consumers to purchase their EV over competitors?

 

Dyson is entering a market that is not favorable for them by observing the 5 forces and competitive advantage of the players. Dyson is established in household appliances and has created and strong brand such. The capabilities lie mostly powerful digital motors in small appliances, which doesn't not directly apply to EV's. The company is innovative with its products and they are well designed subjectively according to consumers, but their is knowledge in the EV market Dyson does not have to be a strong force in. Additionally, besides just thinking about EVs, the car market is now dipping into autonomous vehicle applications from manufacturers like Ford (bluecruise), Tesla, Cadillac, and Chevy. Even Google has stepped in with Waymo. In order to successfully pull this off, Dyson will need to create a product that is of value to the consumer, but they will also need to communicate that value in order to gain market share in a competitive industry. ",6,"In order to prove that their cost leadership strategy is effective, we would need to know more about Oracle's low operating expenses and EBITDA margins from a financial perspective. If they can also sustain a product that designed well from a systems configuration point such as having a highly automated & centralized service model along with a well managed teams across the company then they could prove a success over. For actual metrics, we need see their value chain and how they utilize that to claim their competitive advantage. We could start by looking at metrics such as their efficiency (operations), customer satisfaction, customer ROI; we also need to see current market share of all players, cost structures, selling price, and net margins of everyone as well. To add, if Oracle can minimize costs will maximizing utilization, they can claim more market share.",9,"The strategy the develops have designed is very unique and one that is valuable to customers who have a lot of money, their product is rare, and difficult to replicate.

The creation comes from addressing their high end clientals potential unmet consumer needs, for example the car elevator (convient and luxury). The developers have identified their competitive advatange to claim value within the market and crafted a clear message to market towards their clients.

Corteva's value proposition statement is: For soybean seed and herbicide customers who are dissatisfied with Roundup Ready being blown onto other crops or seasonal restrictions on Monsanto's spray, our offering provides a year-round liability-free option at the same price.

Corteva has been able to gain market share from Monsanto by differentiating its product through the legal issues placed on Monsanto's product; this differentiation creates a perceived benefit for customers and increases their WTP. Corteva does not have a cost advantage (according to this article), and does not provide a superior product in terms of seed growth or herbicide efficacy. However, Corteva's product can be applied year round without government restriction, and customers place value in that ability.

Differentiation is a value creation strategy; it involves identifying unmet customer needs. In this case, that is year-round applicability of herbicide or freedom from government regulation/liability for chemical blown onto other plants. 

Importantly, companies that compete based on product differentiation will claim value only if they also raise their pricing (otherwise they are simply passing that value onto the consumer). Because of this, Corteva must price its Enlist E3 at a pricepoint higher than Monsanto's Roundup Ready in order for Corteva to claim value. 

Differentiation strategies such as Corteva's are sustainable if the source of the advantage is valuable, rare, costly, difficult to replicate, or systemic. In Corteva's case, the source of the advantage is difficult to replicate. Its primary competitor, Monsanto, is unable to product an herbicide that can be applied year-round without government restriction or with consumers accepting liability for their Roundup Ready being blown onto other crops.    ",8,"Specific concerns/questions to assess the likely success of Dyson's new EV market entry strategy: 

The most critical areas of concern are 1) the initial costs for market entry and product development (an aspect of Dyson's capabilities/resources), 2) Dyson's underwhelming prior experience in the EV industry (an aspect of Dyson's capabilities/resources), and 3) identifying the optimal market and how best to enter it (an aspect of the competitive dynamics of the EV market). 

1. The initial costs for market entry and product development: Dyson needs to build a manufacturing facility and wants to do that within two years with a product launch in year 3. The combination of this expensive initial cost of building the manufacturing facility along with the short timelines that Dyson has planned (2 years and product launch in year 3) may be difficult to adhere to in practice, and can result in a huge increase in expenses and R&D costs. Dyson's cost projections may not be accurate. Problems can arise while building the manufacturing facility, for example. 

2. Dyson's underwhelming prior experience in the EV industry: Current companies in the EV market have decades of experience on Dyson - even Tesla, which is still considered a 'new' entrant to the automotive market. Dyson's history of being the supplier/manufacturer who builds specific engine components for automotives may not be useful experience for Dyson's plans in the EV market. Additionally, Dyson needs to build entirely new teams of employees who have expertise in the automotive and EV industries, which can be a difficult or even impossible task. 

3. Identifying the optimal market and how best to enter it: Dyson plans to build its manufacturing facility in the UK, which may not be the best location from which to enter the EV market. From the UK Dyson is probably best situated to sell in Europe; all of Europe has an EV market size of 2.3 million units in 2021. If the US is included in that market size, then it is 2.6 million. China, however, has an EV market size of 3.5 million units in 2021. Additionally, the Chinese market is fragmented with many different EV manufacturers; this may make it easier for Dyson to break into the Chinese market than the US or European markets, which are dominated by Tesla. This is particularly the case for the US market, as Tesla represented 40% of EV sales in the US from 2010-2019.

     An additional aspect of point #3 is where Dyson builds its manufacturing facility and the impact that decision will have on Dyson's ability to enter different geographic markets. If Dyson builds its manufacturing facility in the UK, for example, it may not be feasible to break into the Chinese market. 

 ",8,"Cost leadership is one of the two basic strategies for gaining competitive advantage (the other is differentiation). In cost leadership, companies will offer a similar product or service at a lower cost than competitors. Examples of brands that do this are Ikea and Walmart. Sources of a cost advantage can be things like performing activities differently, a systemic cost advantage coming out of the company's holistic interaction between its different parts, or a customization of specific services to offer. 

Before certifying that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has an actual cost leadership competitive advantage in the market, the main thing that I would need to know is if Oracle has a sustainable cost advantage. This requires that Oracle's cost advantage be rare and has a low replication risk from other competitors. 

Other specific questions that I would want to know the answer to in order to understand the sustainability of Oracle's cost advantage are: 

* Do Oracle's prices change with scale? Will they go up or down as Oracle expands its market share?

* What is preventing new entrants coming into the market with lower prices? New entrants are often a serious issue for software and IT companies because of few physical needs for market entry. 

* What is the expected industry growth? Does Oracle have a history of exceeding that growth? 

* Do Oracle's projections for its customer computing costs being higher with competitors  include international competitors or just US competitors? International competitors are a significant issue for software and IT companies. 

* What is the split between Oracle's fixed and variable costs? Are either projected to increase with scale? 

* Has Oracle entered any international markets and is that data being reflected here? Are these markets possible expansions in the future, and will Oracle be able to extend its cost advantage into these markets? ",6,"When creating value, companies increase a consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) without increasing costs by more than the amount of WTP increase. Alternatively, companies can decrease a product's cost without decreasing WTP by more than the decrease in product cost. 

When claiming value, companies can increase sales price while holding WTP and cost at a constant. 

Within this framework, Porsche's decisions with the Porsche Design Tower in Miami are more closely aligned with creating value. Porsche identified an avenue to increase a consumer's WTP by building the Dezervator and allowing customer's to have their Porsche cars visible from their living rooms in an elegant display (consumers also get the experience of riding in the Dezervator up to their apartments). The Dezervator increases WTP for not only Porsche automotives, but for the residential tower apartments as well. Simultaneously, Porsche did not raise prices for their automotives, which is in alignment with creating value. 

An additional way to think about this is to frame Porsche's decisions within the two basic strategies for gaining competitive advantage in the marketplace. Strategic value creation occurs when a company's resources and capabilities enable them to create a competitive advantage, generally through differentiation (offering products at a greater cost with perceived benefit) or cost leadership (similar product at a lower cost).  ",6,TRUE,1,19,3,79

For corn and soybean farmers in the U.S. who are dissatisfied with seed and spray combinations that lead to weed resistance and neighboring crop damage, our product provides quality seeds and a new herbicide that does not drift, at a comparable price and the freedom to spray. 

 

Background

Monsanto's Roundup Ready represented80% of the market. The chemical dicamba was added to the mix due to weed resistance. But, the new ingredient evaporates off crops and drifts and attaches to neighboring crops, causing damage to some crops. A limit on when the chemical can be sprayed has left many farmers in a position where they are looking for an alternative. Corteva has an advantage due to the different herbicide, 2,4-D choline is their main ingredient. Which is just as effective yet does not have a drifting problem. Corteva is positioning itself again Monsanto mainly on the spray capabilities over their ingredients. ",7,"Dyson, a British company well known for producing high end vacuum cleaners announced their plan to enter the EV market. In recent years, Dyson has expanded into making a range of household appliances such as a $600 hairdryer/hair tool that has gained large sales in the market. 

While the news to enter the EV market is ambitious, Dyson has the current advantage that their brand image in the market is strong, their products are typically categorized as high quality, innovative and a luxury (differentiated good). But, they face extreme challenges in gaining those ""credentials"" in the EV car market. 

The three most critical areas of concern for Dyson over the next 2 years as they prepare their market entry strategy is how they will structure their position in the industry, entry barriers and their position in the highly competitive landscape of EV production. 

From the data over the 10 years of global EV Sales it shows roughly a 109% increase in total unit sales over the last decade. With a huge part of the market concentrated in sales and production in China. While Tesla, an American EV manufacturer holds a large market share in the US, competitors around the globe are rising. Out of the top 5 EV brands, 3 are Chinese manufactures, Tesla following second and Volkswagen at number 4. Currently, Dyson is differentiated in its current market through product innovation and design. They need to formulate a strong entry point and differentiator into the EV market. This can be done through either creating a cost advantage or differentiation in the market. To identify their structure in the industry, Dyson needs research on demand, growth and volatility. Further info on how they will supply, produce and import their cars. How can they bargain their current share in the market place to be a competitive advantage for them, this could be through current production capabilities they already have. But, only if it is an advantage over current EV manufacturers. 

Dyson needs to look at other entry barriers, while they have estimated their start up costs this does not include advertising/marketing. Especially entering a new segment of the market so different than their current offerings they will need to do a lot of training and teaching to enter the market. Continued concerns over if they have the resources, talent an internal capabilities to enter this market successfully. How will they establish their integration in the market, they claim to not want partners at this time but they have huge barriers in entering the market especially when looking at how they will sell/supply their product. 

Finally, their competitive rivalry in the EV industry. EV manufacturing industry while growing rapidly is becoming heavily diversified. With 300 EV models available in China, Dyson needs to be strategic on where they enter the market and what they solve by entering the market. Their current advantages are engineering capabilities, design and a well known British brand. The European market is at 35%, US 8% and the rest of the world is 7%. Identify where Dyson can drive a wedge between competitors and enter there. 

Taking a closer look at Dyson, the company claims they already produces necessary components for EV cars such as high speed motors and batteries. Their Singapore team has claimed to produced 50 million high speed digital motors which are essential elements of the EV car. But, where this fails at the current state is identifying if this is a competitive advantage or resource advantage over the competitor. This needs to be correctly identified to establish this advantage in the competitive dynamics of the market. 

For this claim to be a resource advantage for Dyson, they must past 5 test. It needs to be hard to copy, and since this seems to be a large part of their current business but also EV is does not seem to be hard to copy. There is no information on the depreciation rate, how value is controlled and is there are any other substitutes for this in the car market. But, it can be seen that this portion of their production is extensible to other product offerings. It is unclear if their production of digital motors is a competitive advantage in the market, especially since every car has one. 

 

 ",8,"To identify a cost leadership advantage in the market, Oracle needs to prove they offer a similar product/service at a lower price. The strategy in pricing lower it that companies will produce higher profit margins with a lower price while increasing their market share. In order to asses this, you need to prove that there is a competitive advantage, proving that Oracle is in a better position to change or shape industry and has an advantage over their rivals (AWS, Microsoft and Google) by driving a wide enough wedge between the willingness to pay among their buyers and the cost it incurs. 

Oracle needs to prove that they can either create more value which involves increasing the WTP without increasing costs or decreasing cost without decreasing WTP. 

Oracle could also claim more value by increasing their pricing while keeping their cost constant. How can Oracle be unique and valuable in this industry. 

They are positioning their value to be through pricing, they are pricing at raw infrastructure at a discount to compete with the market leaders. While Oracles cloud revenue rose 66% they are missing a large customer segment. As a later enter into the market, customers have a price reference point for quality and service. Oracle claiming their customer would pay double for their services at competitor brands points towards a weakness in their cast leadership competitive advantage in the market. 

Oracle is proud to be priced significantly cheaper than its competitors but they are missing out on growing their market share in the total cloud revenue further since their target customer they are selling to don't value the lower price as much as they thought. This does need to be proven but it is an assumption that they have not educated their target enough. ",4,"The property developers for the Porsche Design Tower capitalized on the growing luxury condominium market and luxury car market. Porsche, is more than just a well known name but an innovator in luxury, high tech and high performing cars. The developers are levering the Porsche name to create and add value to their development. Especially, in a city like Miami, creating value for the high end consumer goes well beyond just nice finishes and unit enhancements. 

Thats where the addition of the building’s patented car elevator, the Dezervator, which takes residents car and driver up 60 stories to garages residences garages in the sky. They are creating value for a customer segment that at a price range of $4-$32 million have seen a range of developers luxury additions. 

The consumers WTP has been raised over other high end condominiums, the Porsche elevator ads value to the consumer. Through innovation and bragging rights but also functionality. Your car being in your living room 60 stories up ads value and functionality. Porsche is expanding this value through the use of their name throughout but also innovation. 

The profit in the industry is estimated to keep growing at 12.6% every year till 2026. With some units at priced in the 10s of millions that is a huge potential profit.

The cost was huge to build this at around $480 million but it is a highlight of the building and differentiates it from other high end condos.

Compared to another high end luxury condo developer, this has created more value, while we don't know the cost structure it can be incurred to be higher in order to support the development offering and capture the economic surplus. We can expect condos without this added feature is not taking advantage of branding their offerings. It can be inferred they will have a lower WTP while having a similar cost/profit structure.

The main problem was that competitors' products had side effects, such as evaporating in crops, drifting in the wind, and sometimes causing harm to neighboring crops due to inadequate resistance.

However, Corteva differentiated itself by offering a solution without such side effects, alleviating farmers' concerns. This could serve as a differentiation point that increases farmers' willingness to pay, and it also allowed them to sell the product without quantity restrictions due to regulations. With the launch of this differentiated product called Enlist E4, Corteva was able to increase its revenue and sustain profitability, indicating the possibility of value capture.

In this way, Corteva was able to increase its market share.

 ",3,"Resource-Based Advantage:

From a resource-based advantage perspective, Dyson is considered to have some competitiveness. It had already positioned itself as a premium appliance brand in the home appliance market (brand value). Due to the nature of electric appliances that predominantly use electricity, it possessed a talented workforce and a high level of understanding in electronic products.

 

Structural Attractiveness of Market:

Analyzing the market is crucial to assess the likelihood of success. In this case, using the 5 Forces or SCP model can provide insights. By analyzing factors such as Buyer power, Supplier power, Threat of New Entry, Substitutes, and Competitive Rivalry, one can understand the dynamics of the EV market they are planning to enter. Given the absence of prior experience in the EV market, it's anticipated that entry barriers will be high, including factors like factory construction, establishing sales infrastructure, and substantial marketing efforts. Furthermore, Dyson has traditionally used distributors for sales except online, so understanding the implications of shifting to a direct customer strategy or maintaining the distributor channel is crucial (Buyer power, etc.). Considering Tesla's dominant position in the EV industry, closing the technology gap in a short period doesn't seem easy.

 

Source of Competitive Advantage:

In this context, it's important to consider whether Dyson's EV model's price will be lower than consumers' Willingness to Pay (WTP). To achieve consumer surplus, Dyson needs to focus on Value Creation or Cost Leadership. Tesla currently leverages economies of scale to achieve significant cost reduction, so Dyson should think about what unique Value Creation it can bring to the table to compete effectively.

 ",7,"Consistency of Service:

First and foremost, it needs to be established whether consumers perceive Oracle's cloud service as being equivalent to Amazon's (a competitor) service. If what Oracle claims and what consumers experience as a service differ, it cannot be considered as having a Cost Leadership advantage.

 

Data Storage Safety:

Amazon, for instance, operates two separate storage facilities (in different regions) to store the same data. This is a measure to ensure that in case one server goes down or is compromised, the data can be backed up from the other location to avoid disruptions. This undoubtedly incurs additional costs for ensuring data safety, which might influence price increases. Therefore, Oracle also needs to examine the safety of data storage. If, due to natural disasters or other unforeseen events, all data is lost without adequate backup, customers and the company might be deterred from making a purchase, regardless of lower prices.

In this manner, it is important for Oracle to assess these factors to determine its true Cost Leadership advantage.",0,"Yes, it created value. The uniqueness comes from the Porsche design approach. The building itself is designed to cater exclusively to luxury cars, featuring elements like a vehicle elevator system, direct access to your unit's door with your car, distinctive design, and even elevators behind glass walls in front of each unit to store the cars. Many of these factors contribute to value creation. The unique experience of being able to enjoy your luxury car from inside your home is something that cannot be replicated in any other building. Such a distinctive and upscale experience is likely to significantly raise consumer's Willingness to Pay (WTP), and therefore, it can be attributed to creating value. If you're a wealthy Porsche enthusiast, this building would undoubtedly pique your interest.",5,TRUE,1,20,2,69

1. Capabilities/Resources: Dyson is currently well established brand in the household appliances with a slightly higher price but a great offering (differentiated product). Dyson claims to have the technical know how of the basic parts of the car such as high-speed motors and batteries, however, cars need special engineering skills and other technical know how. Given EV is relatively new market with less market penetration, it has huge scope of improvement and optimization, necessitating engineering knowledge and R&D which is capital intensive. Value can be created if the customers WTP is increased, either by differentiating the product or by making the costs low - giving space for higher profits. Competing with the other EV manufacturers - in terms of lowering the costs down, cheap raw materials, machinery etc. Selecting the location where to set up manufacturing, which country to target from the start (operational decisions and target market). 

2. Competitive dynamics: in general buying a car is capital heavy and is usually done after research which also involves brand loyalty. Dyson has no experience in the space and thus will be difficult to penetrate in the market. Heavy marketing, playing on strengths and utilizing the ""credentials"" would be necessary to enforce brand loyalty. Competitive advantage can be achieved through differentiated product or cost advantage. Differentiated product would need heavy R&D - capital intensive or cost advantage - could be achieved with economies of scale or mass production or reducing the production/manufacturing cost.

3. Structure of EV market: Economics of demand - very high. Given EV is a niche and growing market, demand for EV is likely to increase which can generate high profits. Differentiation of the product is necessary. Top 2 EV manufacturer are from China which have various advantages - low labour cost, low COGS etc lowering down the fixed and variable cost for the manufacturer. ",6,"We would need financial and operating performance metrics and comparative cost structure. eg: Gross Profit, Operating margin, ROE etc.)

Will Oracle be able to sustain the lower prices in the longer term?

What is the biggest differentiator in the product for oracle and its competitor. How is Oracle leveraging the rival's strategic policy choices.

Cost based advantage is only and only when the product being offered is with the same capabilities and functionalities but at a lower cost. Additionally, cost can be reduced, however, that should not be designed in such a way that the company is not making profits or is in loss which is not sustainable in the longer term. Making sure that a company is in the cost based advantage only when the metrics such as Gross profit, Operating margin, ROE etc are profitable. Even if it not profitable in the shorter term, what plans does the company have for the longer term to maintain the cost structure but increasing the overall profit of the firm. 

Another important thing to keep in mind is how the company differentiates itself to sustain the cost based advantage in the longer term. comparing the cost structure and the unit sales with the competitors gives a fair idea on how the company is performing in terms of its cost advantage.",5,"Porsche is creating and claiming the value. Reasons:

1. Designing such a building that provides expeirience is making the customers WTP high.

WTP rises when the product is differentiated fromt he market. Creating such an expirience is enticing the customers to pay a higher price by creating a brand image along with the super speciality car. The elevator is a classic example of to increase WTP: ""It was a natural continuation to transfer our unique design principles to the world of real estate""

2. Porsche is also claiming value by charging high price for its cars. 

With these two considerations, Porsche is raising the WTP of the customers while increasing the price of the customers which increases the wedge between the two attributes leading to a higher value created and claimed. 

 

Cost involved in building such a building is a one time cost with regular maintenance but is a way to create hype and build brand value. Cars are priced high for which the COGS and other expenses must be high but not that high.

Rethink the design to get more rooms across a smaller amount of space, which means fixed cost will be allocated to more rooms, supporting the cost leadship strategy.

The overall footprint of the property is smaller,  and will largely be away from big-city centers, keeping land costs down.

Keeps costs down is through designs that allow for some part of the construction process to be done offsite.

These will help decreae the fixed cost and support the cost leadship strategy.

Decrase the variable cost

The rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. Rather than carpet, floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped, which dcrease the cleaning cost of room. This will support the cost leadship strategy.

In-room desks and coffee makers have been banished, also to cut down on cleaning times, which will decerase the variable cost and support the cost leadship strategy.

 

Make a trade-off in the space of room and space of lobby

Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range, which create more space for lobby.

Threats of New Entrants

There is a large group of newer manufacturers trying to enter and capture untapped markets. Manufacturers in China are taking the lead, as exhibited in the EV manufacturer market sales data from 2021, where several other manufacturers have made sales of over 2.5 Million units in 2021.

Bargaining Power of buyers

With so many options in the market and lowered-cost offerings from Chinese manufacturers there exists moderate buyer powers. The cost of switching is very high and hence manufacturers have an advantage here.

Threats of substitutes

Threats of substitutes are very high as there are hybrid options and many other vehicle options. There is overlap with buyers choosing to use public transport, EV bikes, and other alternates

Bargaining power of suppliers

Suppliers have high bargaining power for their special parts and products as they are unique to make and require specialized labor and facilities.

Competitive rivalry

The market is dominated by a few players who have high brand value and manufacturing expertise along with established sales trajectories. The competitive rivalry is high amongst low-cost value offerings as well as in the premium range due to brand domination.

competitive dynamics of the EV market

since the auto industry is dominated by players with large funds, resources, and years of car-making know-how Dyson faces huge threats as a new entrant. Their timeline to build in 2 years & start sales in the consecutive year is rather tight.  Competing against electric-car pioneer Tesla Inc. and other major automakers is going to be one of its biggest challenges. Depending on Dyson's target market, BYD and other manufacturers in the Chinese market can cause coherent difficulties including providing their customers with pricing advantages.

The combination of eccentric tower design along with the Dezervator has tapped into the value of both the property as well as the Porsche brand leverage. They have been successful in creating a clear differentiation by creating a perceived benefit and highlighting the needs of their premium target, who are motivated by luxury and extravagance. 

Through this model Porsche is able to create value for its cars for continued purchase from passionate buyers and enthusiasts, as well as attract newer premium car buyers to select the Porsche for added social perception benefits.

These choices work to differentiate Tru from other competitors and Hilton's own offerings by creating a boutique-like experience through its choices on design, construction, and guest services. These choices fall under cost leadership because they each work to lower the cost of serving the customer while limiting the effect on WTP. For example, making each room smaller is a way of reducing costs, however, this reduction might lower customer WTP. To counter that negative effect on WTP, Hilton made the shared areas of the hotel more attractive to customers.",9,"Corteva Enlist E3 is the best soybean-and-spray combination for farmers concerned about wind drift because it does enables farmers to spray without the headache of affecting other crops.

 

This value proposition enables Corteva to gain market share by positioning its product indirectly against Monsanto (as the industry leader), showing that it does the same job as Monsanto's product without the ill effects. Language such as ""I have the freedom to spray"" calls back to Monsanto's deficiencies while highlighting the difference Corteva's offering provides.",3.5,"Threat of New Entrants/Entry Cost - Dyson may have the initial capital to invest ($2.6 bln) in entering the EV market, however, there is likely a significant hill to climb to become successful in this market. Citing RTE Cereal, success in bringing a new product to market is not guaranteed -- for example, it took 15 to 30 tries to successfully launch a new cereal as an incumbent firm. Of course, the EV and RTE Cereal markets are different but the takeaway is the same: successful launch isn't just initial fixed costs, it's also the costs to figure out what works to be successful.

 

Supplier Power - As another entrant into the market, suppliers could take advantage of Dyson's limited competence in negotiating deals for raw materials. Specifically, suppliers would have another firm to deliver goods to, increasing their bargaining power with Dyson. Since Dyson wouldn't be a main customer, the suppliers (industrial steel, for instance) could extract more economic rents from them than a more established player like Tesla.

 

Competitor Rivalry - We should also consider competitive response to Dyson entering the EV market. While Dyson may have ""credentials"" and the ability to make components of EVs however, their competitors have already figured out how to source, transport, and market EV as a whole system. Competitors likely have more favorable deals with industrial suppliers (to create the frame of the vehicle) than Dyson would have and competitors have the resources to market their EVs more effectively than Dyson can.",3,"Additional information regarding the COGS and SG&A of Oracle and competitors would be useful in determining if they have a genuine cost leadership edge. This data would enable me to determine the margins of each business.

This is a good sign of cost leadership, but not enough to say for certain.",4,"The developer pursued a differentiation strategy where they created value by installing the elevator and designing the building for car enthusiasts and claiming that value by charging a premium to tenants. Reviewing the costs and breakeven occupancy rate based on the rents charged to tenants, we can see this developer creating and claiming value. The developer invested $48 mln to differentiate their building from others, which created value. The developer then charged a price to cover the investment cost and profit. Assuming $4 mln per unit, the developer would need 91% occupancy to breakeven on their investment, however, assuming $32 mln per unit, the developer would only need 11% occupancy to breakeven on their investment.

It is likely that there will be demand at the higher price for these units given that the target market for this product, luxury car owners who want a luxury condo to show off their car, is likely to grow as well according to the article. This means that there will be WTP the higher price of the condo, putting the per unit cost closer to $32 mln.

Customer's will rely on more tested, longer produced, and lower-cost EVs by the time Dyson enters the market in 2026.

However, It is also too soon to determine whether this Tower has created value in developing this structure, although I feel it is reasonable to assume that Porsche has indeed created value through this project, by employing the generic Differentiation strategy.

The basic strategy Porsche is employing here is the differentiation strategy. With the uniqueness of the building’s patented car elevator, the Dezervator, which whisks both cars and drivers up 60 stories to units with sky-high garages, is a ""highlight” of the building and what distinguishes the Porsche Design Tower from any other building in Miami Beach. This feature is not easily replicated, as the Dezervator alone costed roughly ten percent of the $480 million construction cost. Additionally, this feature along with the rest of the Porsche Design Tower, is an integrated ""activity"" which acts in harmony with and reinforces it's other high-end, exclusive products. This is referenced by the case statement saying, ""Porsche Design Tower has the same sleek, souped-up masculine energy of the cars"". 

 

Reasoning for why we cannot be certain yet about value creation/claiming: 

Total Economic Surplus is the difference between customer's willingness to pay and the firm's costs. We do not yet know what customers are willing to pay for this type of product. Plus, economic profit is the difference between accounting profit and the companies cost of capital. We do not have enough information in the case to determine what the cost structure of this project was. 

The assumption I am making that Porsche did indeed create value, is based on their competitive advantage generated by neutralizing unattractive features of its industry and instead exploiting the valuable features.

Barriers to Entry are high in the EV market:

The barriers to entry into the EV market are high and hence it will be hard for Dyson to enter the market. Dyson is best known for its range of household appliances and already makes components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries but those are only two components that go into the development of an EV. Dyson may not necessarily have the capabilities or resources to build an electric car based on their expertise in household appliances. The competitive dynamics in the EV market are extremely high as all the players in this market have deep pockets and have been in the car manufacturing industry for decades.

Competitive rivalry is high in the EV market:

The competitive rivalry within the market is high. Dyson does not have the capabilities to compete with the economies of scale enjoyed by the incumbents. There are seven main brands in the EV market and Tesla leads in terms of worldwide vehicle sales and the competitors are right behind them trying to gain market share and become the market leader. There is intense competition within the Top 5 EV brands' sales shares as 3 Chinese manufacturers are in the Top 5. China has the largest sales of EV hence there is intense competition to capture market share in China.

High Buyer power in EV market:

Dyson is not a recognized brand in the car manufacturing/EV market hence buyers will be less willing to try their product. China is the largest market for EV cars as 6.8M units were sold in just 2021. Customers also have high switching costs because after buying one brand, they are less likely to switch to a different brand. The buyers have high brand loyalty.",5,"In order to determine whether Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a cost leadership advantage in the market, I would need to know the following:

Porsche is creating value because they are able to increase customers' willingness to pay for a condominium.

Customers that buy these condominiums already have devout loyalty to the Porsche brand and through this project, they are adding more value for the customers. This is similar to what Ducati did as they created value through the establishment of the Ducati Owners Club and other events at racetracks.  

Porsche is also claiming value because they are able to generate significant profit from the sale of the condos. Based on my assumption, the average selling price of the condo is $18M. If they are able to sell all 132 condos, they will generate revenue of $2.376B. With the development cost of $480M, Porshe will gain a profit of $1.896B. Hence, they are able to increase their prices without affecting the customers' willingness to pay. They are also claiming value due to their differentiation advantage, this has allowed them to charge higher prices for the condos.

Dyson does have brand recognition for being a design leader for household goods which is a resource for the brand but that doesn't mean they will have a competitive advantage within the car space. Additionally given they are known for expensive household goods they will likely not be competing on a cost leadership strategy. Even if they are able to have brand loyalty from a household goods side that doesn't mean that loyalty will translate to cars. Just because a customer is comfortable buying a Dyson blow dryer or vacuum doesn't mean they would be comfortable getting in a car made from the same company when they can pick a car from a company that has many years of successes and failures in the industry. 

2. Limited time to market proposed:

Car companies have been around for decades and EV car companies have been testing capabilities for many years so to target a car being produced one year after the manufacturing facility is built seems very fast. This level of speed could lead to a lack of trust within potential customers given other car companies have been producing EV car for years and have been able to test out potential failures. Additionally within that short time span what points of differentiation  will Dyson be able to produce given they are entering a highly competitive market with major players. 

3. Minimal prior testing or research conducted: 

The article mentions Dyson's team in Singapore has made 50 million high-speed digital motors but the article doesn't suggest these have been tested. These motors are only one component of a major car build. This is a good resource to have but will still require adequate testing to insure the motor is able to function properly and the rest of the car is also functioning as expected. Given Dyson doesn't want to collaborate with another brand they don't have those resources and knowledge to tap into when designing and testing the car. ",4,"When determining if Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market you would need the prove the information below:

1. brand strength and favorability among target customers

2. Price point/willingness to pay among target customers

3. # of repeat cloud purchases that are potential within this target demographic segment

4. sales and profitability date of this product line when compared to the rest of the company

Some one who doesn't like Porsche might still be enticed to purchase in the building given the design. 

Additionally the developers are claiming value because they are taking the brand value and loyalty the Porsche brand offers and providing an additional offering which is a building to live in.

1. Differentiation in the competitiveness of the market. There are several competitors in the market. Unless Dyson can offer a greater perceived benefit or cost leadership at a lower cost, They can not gain a competitive advantage.

2. Difficulty in building up the value chain from scratch.  Even though Dyson has experience selling everyday appliances, the value chain of a car is totally different from that; therefore, they need to set up a whole value chain like the logistics, operation, Marketing/Sales, Services as a primary activity, and support activities like procurement, technical development, HR, infrastructure. 

3. Resource-based advantages. There are many competitors in the market, moreover, it is not hard to enter and be substituted. Dyson would not be capable of controlling the value of the product without differentiation.

 ",9,"For farmers who are worried about being held liable for harming their neighbors and their crops, our product offers you a powerful weed killer at a reasonable price. 

Corteva was already a dominant player in the soybean seed market. However, an opportunity opened up when the crops that they were helping their customers grow were at risk from weeds. Because their direct competitor offered a failing product that had a potentially expensive drawback they began to offer their own. Once it was realized that their own product could be used with no worries, they of course would dominate the market. The ability to substitute one week killer for the other makes it an easy choice for any farmer. Once they make this choice, it could be easier for them to also consider their soybean seeds since logic might suggest that they should be used together for maximum effectiveness. ",6,"With some of the largest markets dominated by already profit-producing EV makers, how do you expect to sell off all $50 million at a price that can cover your 2 billion pound pledge to the project and produce profits in later years while also claiming a significant amount of market share?

One area of concern of mine is that Dyson has no experience in the EV industry. Full stop.

 ",5,"I believe the developers of the Porsche Design Tower have done both, they have created value and are claiming it. With the market in name-brand luxury condominium units projected to grow 12% until 2026, the developers are claiming this demand and opportunity to deliver the value that is being asked. When they decided to include an elevator for each unit owner to whisk their sports car to their apartment, they also purposely created something that was not necessarily asked for but has definitely helped in attracting the target segment. The elevator can be thought of as a complement to the apartment because it screams both uniqueness and adds to the luxuriousness of the apartment, which is what is being considered in the first place. The Design Tower also gives Porsche owners, in particular, the opportunity to really show their love and dedication to the brand by living in an apartment that was specially made for them and their sports car. This differentiates them from their competitors because it allows them to charge the owner a higher rent for the additional ""tenant"" when in reality, the owner of the apartment is more than happy to use this elevator and have their car in their unit whenever it is not being used. One potential effect on the market is that wealthy people who missed out on the Porsche Tower and who are still looking for an apartment may begin to hope other apartments with a Dezervator start popping up. The Porsche Tower may have changed luxury real estate, at least in Miami, for good and it is up to the competition to respond accordingly. ",7,TRUE,1,13,9,51

Entry Barrier: Dyson faces a high treat to enter this market because it requires huge capital investment, high learning curve. It also has  no plans of collaborating with other car makers which leads to no economics of scale further worsening entry positions. However, Dyson has unveiled plans to commit £2 billion ($2.6 billion) to the project, including £200 million on U.K.-based testing and research-and-development facilities, can eliminate some of the threats to entry. 

Rivalry among competitors- There is a huge competition in the electric vehicle market  with players like Tesla, BYD , wuling, GAC and Volkswagen taking the leads. Each of these companies are steadily innovating and differentiating their brands to take up market share. These companies already have high fixed -to-variable cost ratio and excessive industry capacity following a long standing investment. Although already makes components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries and Its teams in Singapore have made 50 million high-speed digital motors, an essential element of electric cars, this force is still is moderately unfavorable for Dyson.

 ",7,"I would look at the Porter 5 Forces to analyze the industries profitability attractiveness, opportunities and threats:

1. Rivalry among existing competitors: Competitors in the market are growing with 2 clear bigger players pero  a lot of other little players, which you can infer that the industry has room for another one, at least in that part where it is still fragmented.  Also there are big brands that are now participating in the EV market, that will definitely invest more when the EV market expectations of growth are bigger and faster than right now. 
Dyson would really need to differentiate its car with a good value proposition to capture new market and steal market from its main defined competitors as soon as possible. They would need to build a brand name in this industry before other competitors enter with huge investments. 

2. Threat of new entrants: Right now the automobile industry goes on a transition from battery vehicles to EV, as you can see, different well know automobile manufacturing brands have incorporate into their portfolio the EV Line/Model(s).
Entering this industry is very complicated because its players are really known-big and have a big economic power. However, Dyson already builds components that are necessary for EV, which could give them an advantage to differentiate themselves, investing in key components and making their products more attractable. Also the learning curve in this process is minimized and with a greater value proposition they could make customers switch to their brand. 

3. Bargaining Power of Buyers: 
Right now the buyer has more power because as it is a growing industry and trend they can easily switch from brands (low switching costs). This is an opportunity for Dyson because if the product satisfies the customers needs they will capture market share and start building reputation over the market.

Dyson will need to be able to manufacture other parts of EVs at a low cost and utilize its intensive manufacturing capabilities to do so.

* Vertical integration: Car manufacturers, especially EVs oftentimes own dealerships directly, allowing them to capture margins that usually go to car dealers. Dyson will need to take into account the initial cost of setting up those dealerships or determining how much margin will go to other dealerships.

* Differentiation of product: Dyson will come up against manufacturers that some of which have been in the market for over 10 years.

2) Bargaining power of Suppliers: Dyson will need to purchase manufacturing materials from the suppliers who already have good relations with the current market players which I assume will reduce their costs. Dyson's production costs will therefore be higher than their competitors.

3) Bargaining power of Buyers: There is customer loyalty in this market with high switching costs. This makes it difficult for a customer to buy Dyson EV's. Dyson will have to spend on Research and development to differentiate themselves, attract a target segment of the total addressable market and steal market share from competitors like Tesla, Volkswagen Group, SAIC, BYD, Wuling & GAC.

For corn and soybean farmers 

Who are dissatisfied with using herbicides that evaporates/drift after spraying crops and spread to other crops causing damage in the process.

Our offerings provides herbicides that do not drift away after spraying the crops and are authorized to be sprayed in any state 

At a lower price

Explanation based of the value proposition statement  

Corteva has been able to gain market share by capitalizing on the defect in using Monsanto's Dicamba herbicide which evaporates from crops and drifts to other crops and damaging such crop that lacked resistant to the herbicide.

Furthermore, Corteva has leveraged on the regulatory restriction of Dicamba in some states and have capitalize on this to customers as having "" freedom to spray"". ",6,"Specific concerns/questions to Dyson's success in the EV market

1  Threat of New Entrants : . From the case, it can be hypothesized that the EV market is very capital intensive and as such will require a lot of capital for Dyson to break into this market.The economies of scale is critical to assess Dyson's capital to invest in the EV market. Also, customer loyalty to existing brands is key this industry and this is further enhanced by the high switching cost in this industry . Although Dyson already has substantial experience in making some parts that are useful for the EV industry, it would still require a lot of marketing and publicity to grow its brand. 

2 Competitive rivalry :  There exist a very low pool of rivalry in this industry. However, the competitors are competing on high prices to customer thereby not sacrificing its price to gain customers. This can be deduced from the case with is world wide sales growth of 109%

3 Threat of substitute :  Substitute to the EV markets are typical vehicles that run on Gas, and due this are threats to the EV industry. Luxurious cars that run on gas could be major threats due to the stylish nature of these vehicles and their respective power horses.

 

 

 

 

 ",4,"In order to prove that Oracle is indeed at competitive advantage than it competitors we will need some additional information and market data. Some of these information to hypothesis this will be:

* Gross Profit Margin: Oracle's gross profit margins as against its other top players such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google Cloud and Alibaba. A comparison of the gross profit across board will be essential for determining which player has a cost leadership competitive advantage. This is calculated as Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold/Revenue * 100%

* The Net margin: This help to determine the profitability of the business and show effectiveness of the management. This is calculated by Profit After Tax/Revenue * 100%

* Return on Asset: This provides insights on the effective use of Oracle's assets to its net income. This is calculated by Net Income/Total Assets 

* Return on Equity: This gives insights as to the effectiveness of the shareholders equity invested in the company.

From the above case, it can by hypothesized that property developers of the Porsche Design Tower are creating value. This creation of value is presumed by targeting existing customers of not just the Porsche vehicles but generally lovers of luxury lifestyle. For example, the feel of trying out the Dezervator is one that most owners of luxury brand vehicles would want to experience as a complement to owning one of these luxurious vehicles. ",7,TRUE,1,17,5,65

Primary Activities- inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service. 

The inbound logistics of Tru will be a little cheaper in comparison to others as they are hoping to reduce their costs in an entirety. Their operations will be to stay away from big-city centers as that will help keep land costs down. They also mentioned that they plan to keep the overall overall footprint of the property small as well. Outbound logistics will follow in the same pursuit in which they will be as minimal as Tru can make them be. Marketing and Sales will be utilized but still fairly low as they Tru plans to keep costs down as much as possible. Service will be good because they are hoping to have a lobby that is typically 80% larger than the typical Hilton lobby. They will also have self-serve market area where guests can help themselves to Craft beer and food. Not only that, but Tru will also have recreation areas and space for guests to work in a more respectable space (i.e. in pods). An issue they run into is if they can generate sufficient returns with their price range since it is on the lower spectrum. However, their combating methods of bigger lobby and adding features that will attract guests is a good idea. As a whole, Tru is trying to be competitive with lower prices while still offering good amenities in order to attract customers (that is their competitive position - low prices, good quality). ",6,"Value Proposition for Corteva: For farmers who are trying to grow healthy crops (i.e. soybeans) who are dissatisfied that a previous chemical, Dicamba, has been evaporating crops and drifting in the wind. Our offering provides farmers with an alternative herbicide product - Enlist E3 - that does not evaporate crops and drift in the wind at a reasonable price. 

Corteva has been able to gain market share from Monsanto in the soybean and herbicide market by having an alternative to Xtend and XtendFlex (Monsanto's products). Monsanto's products have been causing issues to crops such as evaporating them as well as having it drift in the wind because it contains Dicamba. The farmers were worried about this, and Corteva took this as an opportunity for themselves. They did not include the chemical Dicamba in their herbicide which helped them gain market share since people were being drawn to their product since it did not contain Dicamba. ",6.5,"The three most critical areas of concern I see are new entry threat, competitive rivalry, and buyer power. First and foremost, it would be hard to enter the automotive market as it is already a big force dominated by lots of companies like Tesla and Volkswagen. Changing the industry's competitive norms can be worth a lot of money. Second, the competitive rivalry is high mainly since there are bigger automotive companies already in the industry for years. The profitability for the market depends crucially on the rival's response and the competitors should know the other's behaviors. Third, and lastly, the buyer power is high. Since the automotive industry already has strong players it would be difficult to join the market. The switching cost of the automotive industry is fairly low when the contract is over. However, most people would just stay with the current brand they are already with as they are loyal to that brand/automotive company. The Dyson car does not serve as a substitute to the other EV cars already in the market.  

 ",2,"I would want to see more financials to Oracle. I would want to know the gross margin, operating margin, key cost structure (i.e. COGS), and average price for each unit. Also, it could be helpful to know the Return on Equity (ROE) of the company through the net income, sales, total assets, and average share holder's equity. This would help me get a better idea of where Oracle is siting on a financial level. If the profit margins are increasing then so it the return on equity and that is the good thing since profit margins are measuring the profitability of a company.

I would also want to know their target customer demographics, sales growth rate, market/share shifts, and margin growth rate as all these would give me better overview to the company itself. Since Oracle is pricing its cost lower than than the other company's it is in the realm of cost leadership. The resources and capabilities help give a company their competitive advantage. In order to have a competitive cost advantage I would want to choose a typical unit sale for competitors, identify activities performed to produce sales, focus on differences in rival's strategic policy choices, use available information and make reasonable assumptions, and compare unit costs to identify cost advantage. Knowing these would then allow me to better understand the willingness to pay, price, and cost to figure out the consumer surplus, profit, and total cost per unit.",7,"Porsche Design Tower is claiming the value. The sales price is increasing for the cars, while the cost and willingness to pay are both held constant. The Porsche Design Tower is feeding into the illusion of the luxury car, and making it more of an all-around experience for these car users. They are gaining competitive advantage by having a unique and valuable ""product"" for their customers. They are distinguishing themselves from others in the market. Essentially, they are shaping the industry by shaping the balance of forces to create a new favorable structure in this market and neutralizing the supplier and customer power. They are claiming this experience or ""product"" to be luxurious by the use of the cars. They are helping themselves position their company at a better standing/position (finding position where the forces are the weakest), then exploiting change (identifying opportunities - investment, diversification, and allocation, and then shaping the industry (creating a new favorable structure). When a company competes on differentiation, they are claiming value if they raise price, and that is what Porsche Design Tower is doing. They made the price of these rooms extremely high (raised the price), and this indicates that they are claiming the value. ",7,TRUE,1,12,10,47.5
