17,"At first glance, the new hotel chain on track to be the fastest-growing in the U.S. resembles a boutique brand that might be found in a trendy, urban location. But Hilton's new mid-price brand, Tru, is pricing rooms at around $100 a night or less and is largely aimed at less-flashy locales like suburban highway exits. The first Tru by Hilton hotel opened in May in Oklahoma City, to be followed by more than 200 locations in the US.
Hilton hopes to expand its customer base by focusing on a lower end of the market than the company has typically operated, but plans to differentiate itself from competitors in the same price range, such as Best Western or Quality Inn. The market is enormous: About 30% of nightly demand at U.S. hotel chains is for rooms below an average of $83 a night.
The challenge, however, is convincing developers that building new hotels in that price range will generate sufficient returns. To make the returns worth the new development costs, Hilton had to rethink the design to get more rooms across a smaller amount of space. Another way the company keeps costs down is through designs that allow for some part of the construction process to be done offsite.
Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range. The overall footprint of the property is smaller, too, and will largely be away from big-city centers, keeping land costs down. Openings in coming months are scheduled in places like Farmville, Va., and Cheyenne, Wyo.
In exchange, Tru hotels have a lobby that is more than 80% larger than Hilton's typical Hampton Inn location, which is priced slightly higher than Tru. The brightly-colored lobbies have a self-serve market area where guests can get drinks like Craft beer and food, and also boasts recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work.
The rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. Rather than carpet, floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped, and in-room desks and coffee makers have been banished, also to cut down on cleaning times.
""We have been laser-focused on what numbers we absolutely need to hit,"" said Alex Jaritz, global head of the Tru brand.
Other competitors cautioned that achieving the right returns can be tricky at more affordable price points. ""A lot of people try to enter this marketplace and find it's not as easy as they believe it is,"" said Chip Ohlsson, executive vice president and chief development officer for North America atWyndham Hotel Group,which runs the Ramada and Wingate chains. ‚""Where we operate, there's less margin for error.""","Tru's leaders have made some clear strategic choices within the brand's activity system to support the overall competitive positioning. Identify the specific choices/configurations within the business system that contribute to Tru's market positioning. Using the table format below, organize the primary activities and your brief description of how they support competitive positioning under the corresponding business activity segment.

18,"Together, Monsanto and Corteva sell roughly 70% of all corn and soybean seeds planted in the U.S. The companies are in hot competition for the billions of dollars that farmers spend each year on seed-and-chemical combinations designed to combat hard-to-kill weeds. 
Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybeans represented more than 90% of the market for roughly two decades, according to analysts. The company added dicamba to the mix to combat weeds that had developed resistance to Roundup's main ingredient, glyphosate, to develop its new Xtend and XtendFlex products in 2017, which now make up about 45% to 50% of the U.S. soybean market.
Dicamba, however,can evaporate off crops and drift in the wind, sometimes damaging neighboring crops that lack resistance to it. Some farmers were fearful of the headaches and liability that came along with the spray. To prevent dicamba from drifting under summer heat, some states placed limits around when dicamba can be sprayed on crops, dissuading some growers from using Monsanto's product.
Corteva in 2019 launched its competing soybean-and-spray combination, called Enlist E3, built around a herbicide known as 2,4-D choline. That weedkiller doesn't have the same problem with drift, according to various studies and field work by university agricultural researchers.
Restrictions on Monsanto's spray have become a selling point for Corteva. At an August farm show in Decatur, Ill., Corteva sales representatives told growers that Enlist doesn't have the same spraying limitations as its competitor's product. Corteva displayed signs that said ""I have the freedom to spray.""",Use the Value Proposition Statement to explain how Corteva has been able to gain market share from Monsanto in the soybean seed + herbicide market,Corteva value proposition statement and market share capture. 8 points; 2 points apiece for each of the 4 elements of the value proposition statement.,"For: US Soybean farmers who use a soybean + herbicide cultivation system

19,"Dyson Ltd., best known for its high-end vacuum cleaners, said Tuesday it plans to build electric cars. The closely held British company said a manufacturing facility would be built in 2 years and that its vehicles' set to compete against electric-car pioneer Tesla Inc. and other major auto makers‚Äîwould go on sale the following year.
Dyson, which makes a range of household appliances, unveiled plans to expand into car makinglast year, pledging to commit ¬£2 billion ($2.6 billion) to the project, including ¬£200 million on U.K.-based testing and research-and-development facilities.
The company faces a tough challenge breaking into an auto industry dominated by players with deep pockets and years of car-making know-how. But Dyson has made a mark around the globe by fusing innovative engineering and design to provide fresh takes on everyday appliances such as vacuum cleaners, fans and hand dryers.
The company has said it plans to rely on those credentials in developing electric vehicles, and that it won't collaborate with other car makers. Dyson already makes components necessary to build vehicles, such as high-speed motors and batteries. Its teams in Singapore have made 50 million high-speed digital motors, an essential element of electric cars.

EV manufacturer market sales data from 2021 (BYD and SAIC are both Chinese manufacturers)

EV manufacturer market share data from Q3 2022 (1st, 3rd, and 5th-place BYD, Wuling, and GAC group are all Chinese manufacturers. 2nd place is Tesla, and 4th place is Volkswagen).","Dyson has announced ambitious plans to enter the EV market, expressing confidence that its ‚Äúcredentials‚Äù enable them to compete effectively. What specific concerns/questions would you have in assessing the likely success of Dyson's new EV market entry strategy? Please identify the three most critical areas of concern you would have -- and frame your assessment in the specific language of Dyson's capabilities/resources and the structure and competitive dynamics of the EV market.","Areas of concern for Dyson EV market entry. This response will allow the widest range of correct answers. I asked for them to specify three areas of concern. Please give full 3-point credit for any reasonable, well-supported answer for any of the four areas below. They must have at least one answer that is RBV/capability in nature. 9 points; 3 points apiece. You can award partial credit for these or other reasonable answers.","- Resource-based advantage: Dyson claims that it has superior design and engineering capabilities that will enable it to succeed in EVs. We'd need to be convinced that Dyson's capabilities are directly relevant to this new market and are at least at parity with if not better than other players in the EV market.
- Structural attractiveness of EV market: Even if Dyson's capabilities are well suited for the EV market, we would want to explore whether it's even a market we would want to be in. Dyson has historically excelled in markets for high-end electric consumer products like vacuums and dryers. Those markets are probably very different from the automotive manufacturing market. We would want to conduct a thorough structural analysis of the market. For instance, capital construction costs (entry barrier) might be prohibitively high for a player the size and scale of Dyson. Likewise, scale requirements might consign them to always being sub-scale, unprofitable player
- Source of competitive advantage: Even if Dyson cleared the first two hurdles above, we'd want to know how they planned to position themselves for competitive success in the EV market. What will their approach to value creation and capture be - and is that a sustainable and defensible position? Can it be easily imitated? Will it result in consumer WTP or can they develop an advantaged cost position? What sets of activities will go into supporting their market positioning choices and what is their economic logic?
- Rapid evolution of EV market and gravitational center in China: As the charts show, the epicenter of the global race to dominate the EV market is China - and that market is developing rapidly. The Chinese players who are catapulting to market leadership positions are going to achieve competitively advantaged positions due to scale-based economies of learning and production. So even if Dyson could clear all three of the previous hurdles, it may well be that any competitor who doesn't have a foothold in the Chinese market is not going to be able to survive.",9,These are only example exemplary answers. Make sure that the reasoning is well-supported.
20,"A decade into its cloud-computing shift, Oracle has a message for those who know it primarily as a database heavyweight with hardball sales tactics: We‚ are cheaper than the competition.
Oracle's strategy is very explicit in that they intend to capture share at the infrastructure layer by being very competitive on price performance, said Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick. They are pricing raw infrastructure at a discount to the market leaders, full stop. Oracle said that based on data from 2020, it is 61% cheaper thanAmazon Web Services for core computing services, and 38% cheaper than Google Cloud for the same services. Based on one customer's recent projections over a five-year period, Oracle claims that customer would pay more than double for similar services on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.
Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue rose 66% to about $1.5 billion last week for the last quarter. Analysts peg Oracle's cloud business at about 2% of total cloud revenue. Amazon, Microsoft, Google Cloud and Alibaba are the top players in the $120.3 billion cloud infrastructure global market in 2022.","Oracle brags, and analysts agree, that its cloud services are priced significantly cheaper than its competitors. Before you certify that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business has a genuine cost leadership competitive advantage in the market, what would you need to prove (i.e., what additional performance or market data would you need to know)?",Testing whether Oracle's cloud business has a genuine cost leadership advantage. 10 pointes; 5 points apiece for each fo the elements below. You can give partial credit.,"- Cost structure advantage and margin performance: We would need detailed cost structure and operating/net margin information for Oracle. which we could benchmark against detailed cost structure and margin information for their competitor cloud service providers. We know from the article that Oracle is underpricing competitors, but without the cost structure and margin data, it's impossible to determine whether they're simply undercutting on price or if they have a cost-based competitive advantage that enables them to price lower while retaining acceptable margins.
- Growth rate/market share shifts. We know from the article that Oracle's cloud business growth rate was an impressive 66% in the previous quarter, but without knowing the underlying market growth rate and/or the growth rates for key competitors, we can't determine whether they're successfully growing their market share from their current tiny sliver of 2%.",10,Each element makes up a full 5 points each.
21,"Branded real estate is surging: The market for name-brand luxury condominium units is projected to grow 12 percent each year between now and 2026. Now luxury cars are getting in on the trend.

In Miami Beach, the Porsche Design Tower has the same sleek, souped-up masculine energy of the cars. There is no dedicated pedestrian access. Visitors arrive beneath a graphite-hued archway bearing the words ""Porsche Design,"" where they can park and enter the airy lobby or continue in their vehicles into the building's patented car elevator, called the Dezervator, which whisks both cars and drivers up 60 stories to units with sky-high garages.
That elevator‚ which deposits cars behind a glass wall in front of each unit ‚ is a highlight of the building, said Stefan Buescher, the chief executive of Porsche Lifestyle Group, in a statement. ""It was a natural continuation to transfer our unique design principles to the world of real estate,"" he said.
The developer spent $480 million to build the Porsche Design Tower, where 132 units run between $4 and $32 million. Ten percent of the construction cost, he estimates, was on the production of the Dezervator alone.
","Use our value creation and capture framework to explain what kind of generic strategy the property developers for the Porsche Design Tower in Miami have adopted. Are they creating, or claiming, value‚ or both?

The Dezervator at the Porsche Tower. This goldfinch-yellow 911 sits right outside the owner's apartment on the 60th floor, so they can gaze admiringly at it whenever they're home.",Value creation and capture approach to drive generic strategy. 12 points total. 2 points for identifying that the Porsche Design Tower developer is implementing a differentiation strategy; 5 points apiece for the commentary on the approach to value creation and value capture. You can give partial credit.,"- Differentiation strategy: Porsche Design Tower is implementing a differentiation strategy by raising customer willingness to pay through adding extreme car-centric features.
- Value creation: Porsche is increasing economic surplus by raising customer willingness to pay. Branded luxury condo towers are exhibiting strong growth in general of 12%, but even within that market, the developer has invested in engineering truly unique offerings like the Dezervator care elevator and sky high garages that are ultra-luxe and rare.
- Value capture: Whether or not the developer is claiming any of the economic surplus that they have created is impossible to know without comparative pricing and cost structure information for other branded luxury tower developers. The per-unit pricing of $4-$32M may seem high, but pricing for other branded luxury condos (like Aston Martin!) may be even higher. Correspondingly, the development cost of $480M is impossible to evaluate absent competitive construction cost data from other branded luxury towers. Another indicator we could look to would be how quickly condos int he Porsche Design Tower are selling versus competitor branded luxury towers; if PDT units sell more quickly, the developer may intentionally be giving away some, if not all, of the economic surplus it has created in order to gain market share.",1,Noting differentiation strategy is 2 points. Explaining that value is being created by raising price and WTP is 5 points. There is no evidence that value is being captured.
